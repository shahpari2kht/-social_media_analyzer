I have a specific skillset (graphic design and packaging design for print production) that is only partial to all the design jobs out there. I am not good with coding or UX/UI and that sounds miserable to me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where do I trade my joy for a paycheck?!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doubt anyones read this much but I love filmmaking. I collect 16mm cameras and digital cine cameras and shoot weird short films as outsider art. Theres no way I could compete for the limited amount of film prod jobs in Austin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am a very good worker and all, I just worry my career has hit a dead end. I do all this cool work I always wanted to do, which is fulfilling, but I almost never have more than 1000$ to my name at a time and it brings me a lot of stress.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "682e2d40-78e2-11ea-b9b2-0e4e69ee6911", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2t9i0", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#014980", "id": "1ojnt88", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "liquidsystemdesign", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 33, "send_replies": true, "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/careerguidance/comments/1ojnt88/30_years_old_found_that_doing_the_work_i_am/", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1ojnt88/30_years_old_found_that_doing_the_work_i_am/", "subreddit_subscribers": 4720385, "created_utc": 1761790477.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "careerguidance", "selftext": "25.

I will easily take on extra difficulty or lower pay for something that makes me happy. It sounds weird to want fulfillment from your \"day job\" I guess but I want this to be permanent.\n* **Long-Term/Retirement**\u00a0\\- What good is it to fall back on something that wont support you in the long run?\n* **Money**\u00a0\\- I don't care about money any more than I'm forced to. I live a frugal life and I'm happy with it. I also plan to make money outside of the work so it's all good.\n* **Benefits**\u00a0\\- Already mentioned retirement, but obviously healthcare is very important.\n\nSo I'm a content creator, but it's not fully paying the bills right now.

I\u2019m not looking to bash anyone \u2014 I just genuinely want to know if what I\u2019m feeling is reasonable or if I should try to tough it out a little longer.\n\nI\u2019ve been working for an elementary school aftercare program for about two months now. The kids are great \u2014 I really enjoy them and have built good relationships. The issue isn\u2019t the students, it\u2019s my coworkers, and I\u2019m trying to figure out if this is something I should ride out or if I\u2019d be better off requesting a transfer.\n\nFor context, the structure goes: Aftercare Assistant (Me) \u2192 Team Lead (T) \u2192 Site Supervisor \u2192 District Supervisor \u2192 Head of Program. The only person I\u2019d feel comfortable approaching about this is my district supervisor, since she\u2019s been supportive and approachable from the start.\n\nAt School A (my assigned site), I work with:\n\t\u2022\tT (Team Lead): often dismissive and short when I ask questions or try to engage.\n\t\u2022\tC (Older Coworker): close friends with T and generally uninterested in having much of a working relationship.\n\t\u2022\tM (Male Coworker): I only see him twice a week. He\u2019s polite but has moments that come across as dismissive or condescending.\n\nI try to show up every day as a team player. I\u2019m early to every shift, keep things organized, jump in wherever help is needed, and take initiative without being told. I\u2019ve worked in childcare before \u2014 both as an Assistant Teacher and Aftercare Attendant \u2014 so while some policies are different, I\u2019m confident in my ability to do the job well.\n\nThat said, the atmosphere with my coworkers has made things uncomfortable. When I try to make small talk while cleaning or setting up snacks, the conversation either goes silent or changes instantly. I\u2019m not someone who pushes myself into private discussions, but it\u2019s noticeable and awkward. I\u2019ve stopped trying to socialize much and only focus on work-related communication now.\n\nI never received any formal training at this location, so naturally I\u2019ve had to ask a lot of questions to make sure I\u2019m following procedures correctly. Whenever I do, T acts like I\u2019m being a bother. It\u2019s the tone and demeanor \u2014 it feels like I\u2019m inconveniencing her. I\u2019ve caught myself apologizing constantly, which isn\u2019t a habit I normally have in a workplace.\n\nA big thing that concerns me is communication during child counts. Keeping an accurate headcount is absolutely crucial in childcare, especially during transitions. I\u2019m always double-checking, but when I share my count or ask for theirs, I rarely get a response. That lack of coordination feels unsafe, honestly.\n\nI also find that I\u2019m often the one handling most of the behind-the-scenes work \u2014 letting parents in, answering phones, cleaning up, assisting with crafts, and helping with homework \u2014 while others spend more time directly interacting with the kids. I don\u2019t mind the work itself, but it feels like I\u2019m constantly taking on the extra load without acknowledgment.\n\nAn incident today really sealed how off the environment feels. T wasn\u2019t there, so C was in charge. One of the younger kids (about 4) asked to sit on my lap during snack, which isn\u2019t unusual for that age. I said yes and continued chatting with the group. C immediately gave me a sharp look from across the room, shook her head, and told me to put the student down \u2014 loudly, in front of other staff and students. I complied right away, but it felt unnecessarily harsh and embarrassing.\n\nEveryone has different comfort levels with affection in childcare, and I respect that. But I always keep boundaries professional and appropriate. I want kids to feel safe and seen, especially when they\u2019re sad or hurt. At my current site, even the most normal, healthy interactions feel scrutinized.\n\nA few weeks ago, a kindergartner fell face-first on the playground. My coworker M didn\u2019t notice because he was facing the other direction. I went over immediately, checked for injuries, and comforted the student. When I mentioned that she might have hit her head, M brushed it off and told me not to worry about it \u2014 no incident report, no follow-up. It felt dismissive and careless, both toward the student and toward me trying to do my job responsibly.\n\nWithin my first two weeks of working there, I also found a small white insect inside one of the fuse bead bins. I mentioned it briefly but was brushed off and told it was probably just a random bug. The next day, I\u2019m almost certain I saw what looked like mouse droppings at the bottom of that same bin. It made me feel absolutely sick to my stomach. At that point, the environment already felt tense, so I didn\u2019t feel comfortable speaking up again. Now, looking back, I feel disgusted and guilty for not reporting it \u2014 but I genuinely didn\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019ve never worked in a public school district before, and a lot of things already feel disorganized. I really need this job and don\u2019t want to burn bridges before even starting my long-term career with this district once I finish my teaching degree.\n\nNo matter what I do, it feels like I can\u2019t win. If I ask questions, I\u2019m \u201ctoo much.\u201d If I take initiative, I\u2019m questioned or brushed off. Even some of the older students have started noticing the lack of respect and try to test me more than they should.\n\nRecently, I was temporarily assigned to School B for a day due to a staffing shortage, and the experience there was completely different. The team was friendly, communicative, and encouraging. They appreciated my questions, included me in conversations, and told me I was doing a great job with the kids. I didn\u2019t change a thing about how I worked \u2014 the difference was the team dynamic.\n\nNow I\u2019m trying to decide if I should request a transfer to another school under my district supervisor, or stay at School A and hope things improve. I don\u2019t want to seem overly sensitive, but I also value professionalism, communication, and mutual respect \u2014 and I\u2019m not getting much of that right now.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nTLDR:\nLove the kids, but my coworkers are dismissive and create an uncomfortable environment. A temporary placement at another school showed me how much better things could be. I\u2019ve also had a few sanitation concerns that I felt brushed off about. Would I be unreasonable for requesting a transfer after only two months, or should I try to tough it out a little longer?\n\n\u2e3b\n\nI\u2019d really appreciate honest feedback \u2014 even if it\u2019s tough love. I want to handle this the right way and protect my professional reputation while also doing what\u2019s best for my mental health.\n", "author_fullname": "t2_dl2lzp4e", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Should I Request a Transfer to Another School or Stick it out Longer?", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Advice", "hidden": false, "pwls": null, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "name": "t3_1oju07g", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1761812308.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": null, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.Advice", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, I could use some outside perspective on a work situation.

That lack of coordination feels unsafe, honestly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also find that I\u2019m often the one handling most of the behind-the-scenes work \u2014 letting parents in, answering phones, cleaning up, assisting with crafts, and helping with homework \u2014 while others spend more time directly interacting with the kids. I don\u2019t mind the work itself, but it feels like I\u2019m constantly taking on the extra load without acknowledgment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An incident today really sealed how off the environment feels. T wasn\u2019t there, so C was in charge. One of the younger kids (about 4) asked to sit on my lap during snack, which isn\u2019t unusual for that age. I said yes and continued chatting with the group. C immediately gave me a sharp look from across the room, shook her head, and told me to put the student down \u2014 loudly, in front of other staff and students. I complied right away, but it felt unnecessarily harsh and embarrassing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone has different comfort levels with affection in childcare, and I respect that. But I always keep boundaries professional and appropriate. I want kids to feel safe and seen, especially when they\u2019re sad or hurt. At my current site, even the most normal, healthy interactions feel scrutinized.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, a kindergartner fell face-first on the playground. My coworker M didn\u2019t notice because he was facing the other direction. I went over immediately, checked for injuries, and comforted the student. When I mentioned that she might have hit her head, M brushed it off and told me not to worry about it \u2014 no incident report, no follow-up. It felt dismissive and careless, both toward the student and toward me trying to do my job responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Within my first two weeks of working there, I also found a small white insect inside one of the fuse bead bins. I mentioned it briefly but was brushed off and told it was probably just a random bug. The next day, I\u2019m almost certain I saw what looked like mouse droppings at the bottom of that same bin. It made me feel absolutely sick to my stomach. At that point, the environment already felt tense, so I didn\u2019t feel comfortable speaking up again. Now, looking back, I feel disgusted and guilty for not reporting it \u2014 but I genuinely didn\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019ve never worked in a public school district before, and a lot of things already feel disorganized. I really need this job and don\u2019t want to burn bridges before even starting my long-term career with this district once I finish my teaching degree.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No matter what I do, it feels like I can\u2019t win. If I ask questions, I\u2019m \u201ctoo much.\u201d If I take initiative, I\u2019m questioned or brushed off. Even some of the older students have started noticing the lack of respect and try to test me more than they should.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recently, I was temporarily assigned to School B for a day due to a staffing shortage, and the experience there was completely different. The team was friendly, communicative, and encouraging. They appreciated my questions, included me in conversations, and told me I was doing a great job with the kids. I didn\u2019t change a thing about how I worked \u2014 the difference was the team dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I\u2019m trying to decide if I should request a transfer to another school under my district supervisor, or stay at School A and hope things improve. I don\u2019t want to seem overly sensitive, but I also value professionalism, communication, and mutual respect \u2014 and I\u2019m not getting much of that right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2e3b&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR:\nLove the kids, but my coworkers are dismissive and create an uncomfortable environment. A temporary placement at another school showed me how much better things could be. I\u2019ve also had a few sanitation concerns that I felt brushed off about. Would I be unreasonable for requesting a transfer after only two months, or should I try to tough it out a little longer?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2e3b&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019d really appreciate honest feedback \u2014 even if it\u2019s tough love. I want to handle this the right way and protect my professional reputation while also doing what\u2019s best for my mental health.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjdm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "1oju07g", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "chickenwxngs", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 3, "send_replies": true, "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/Advice/comments/1oju07g/should_i_request_a_transfer_to_another_school_or/", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1oju07g/should_i_request_a_transfer_to_another_school_or/", "subreddit_subscribers": 2574367, "created_utc": 1761812308.0, "num_crossposts": 1, "media": null, "is_video": false}], "created": 1761813015.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": null, "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "url_overridden_by_dest": "/r/Advice/comments/1oju07g/should_i_request_a_transfer_to_another_school_or/", "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2t9i0", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "1oju6dg", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "chickenwxngs", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": true, "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "crosspost_parent": "t3_1oju07g", "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/careerguidance/comments/1oju6dg/should_i_request_a_transfer_to_another_school_or/", "stickied": false, "url": "/r/Advice/comments/1oju07g/should_i_request_a_transfer_to_another_school_or/", "subreddit_subscribers": 4720385, "created_utc": 1761813015.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "careerguidance", "selftext": "I live in a major city with a bunch of high earning professionals and I would like to have a career and make good money but for some reason I feel like I just don't fit in.

I didn\u2019t mind my job and the benefits were great, but the commute was awful, the attorneys treated me lowly, and i began to feel it wasn\u2019t what i wanted to do.\n\nI was going to stick it out for a year, but i got a job offer in April for a job I had applied for months previously, as an Assistant director of a non-profit, and it shortened my commute from one hour to five minutes and my pay increased by 25%. So, i took it.\n\nAt this job, i like my coworkers, my job tasks are relatively easy, and my hours are flexible. However, my manager is unstable, the organization\u2019s future is unclear, and i have limited growth opportunities. My boss lies and constantly makes excuses, claiming he works 50-60 hour weeks when we barely see him in the office for 40.

The transition into office culture was okay but obviously different. I was a bit rough around the edges but I am experienced in what I was employed for but a bit rough on the office culture stuff you know. Anyway long story short there were really nice people, but I feel I had a target on my back from my first week, maybe because of my background, or I\u2019m somewhat out of my comfort zone. Here\u2019s a quick recap of why: \n- my work computer was reassigned to a more senior staff by my  manager in my first week (because they didn\u2019t have one yet) This had all my personal information like salary, next of kin, along will my work emails and logins. The company is very big on privacy etc. \n- KPIs were never explained or implemented or even discussed by management. \n- job description not clearly defined, and management couldn\u2019t encompass what\u2019s required.\n- Management we\u2019re quite young and treated staff like Childeren, over the top praise eg you guys have done absolutely amazing today, but then next day say how disappointed they were and threatened firing someone (on their phone) \n-other staff using my work login as theirs was not working, this had all my personal details on there. \n- Very minimal training despite me telling management I need more constantly. They organised training but lasted literally 5 mins then it was cancelled.\n- work hours was explained to be flexible then changed to a rigid hours.\n- had to work over Christmas period, never discussed before.\n- little guidance and support but management, would\nTell their superiors that they are made mistakes, and deflected responsibility.\n- my direct manager became passive aggressive as I swapped a working from home with working from office. The job is totally computer based. The manager told me to come in the office when everyone if working at home as punishment. \n- excluded from some team meetings without explanation.\nManagers giving me instructions via email to another employee, when they are sitting beside me.\n- managers in their own echo chambers and very power hungry.\n- higher above managers not even saying hi in the elevator or walk past with acknowledgment.\n- a lot of my questions (work related ignored in the chat and glanced over) \n-witnessed manager making fun on a co worker on cctv who injured themselves at work and is on leave. \n\nWhat did it for me was my direct manager telling me to come into work, when I was working from home. I explained that I had family responsibility and to switch days (only required 2 days p/w in office) they doubled down and told me to come into the office. It was a power struggle for them, and it highlighted I didn\u2019t want to work here anymore. \n\nUnfortunately Im done with this culture and it\u2019s disappointing as it\u2019s a big career move for me. Has anyone ever experienced this sort of thing? Has not helped with my daily enjoyment and made me feel quite down to be honest. Has anyone else experienced this? I can get work easily.

If people with tons of CS experience can\u2019t get CS related jobs, what are the odds that I could ever get one?\n\nI really regret not taking a gap year between high school and university to consider what I wanted to do with my career.

I am confident in my abilities. \n\nI worked hard to get where I am now but lately everything in the career ladder/corporate world seems meaningless... It is scary really how I lost all the grit I once had. I no longer want to work totally had I have financial freedom.. Probably because of working too long in the industry. \n\n\n\nSo, I have been burn out that I don't see myself working in the industry 5 years from now.. but the achiever in me don't wanna just ditch this career i have worked so hard to get. I am planning if money is not the problem, maybe i could specialize in tax as I see the value we give to the client in tax, maybe 1 client would be enough for me just so I have put this career into purpose (i have tried applying for tax position but it did not push trough next phase after interview as I don't have depth as I am more into audit over the years - i plan to (maybe) specialize in tax after exit in corporate life, maybe just 1 client)\n\nBut mainly i want a planned exit (Although Accounting is a prestigious job and for REAL I AM GRATEFUL to have options, however I feel like I have enough of the corporate life)\n\n\n\nNow, of course i need to work and I cannot just easily stop working and work on meaningful hobbies only (as I have financial responsibilities - I have mortgage for my condo, i have built our family home in the province and plan to improve more, and i am helping with my sibling schooling)  I have been on work break for almost 3 months and I have been applying as well off course.\n\n\n\n So now I have this options I have been weighing on. \n\n\n\nA) Managerial role in a big 4 firm (my previous work place)\n\nThey reached out with a salary of 140k for audit manager for the second time (this is confirmed i made sure). I find it weird coz I think the audit manager position is roughly around 80 - 90k that is why i did not push though when they first reached out because i don't wanna go back again knowing the burnout i felt the first time.\n\nThe pros for this are\n\n1)  my old self 5 years ago would have jumped and take this in an instant. Weirdly, now I just don't wanna go back to the same cage. \n\n2) Managerial position, which gives me a better chance to work abroad (this was my plan before, now i don't want it anymore -- actually i don't see myself working in the industry 5 years from now, although i am not sure which path to take yet)\n\n3) Have socialization (don't have with pure wfh)\n\n4) Higher salary (150k)\n\n\n\nCons:\n\n1) Hybrid (I prefer wfh set up)\n\n2) Burn out toll for sure\n\n3) it is my old company, it feels weird to go back\n\n\n\nB) US firm Audit Senior role (wfh)\n\nThe second is a senior audit role for 110k-120k for US base clients.\n\nPros:\n\n1) I have more time for myself and my hobbies/travel goals since it is night shift.\n\n2) Maybe have a slower pace (base on the interview, I asked their work culture)\n\n\n\nCons\n\n1) It may take a toll on physical health in the long run since it is night shift \n\n2) Progression seems uncertain ( i may be a manager based on the interview - i can lead staffs as the firm is growing, but 5 years from now, i don\u2019t see myself working in the industry)\n\n3) Slightly lower than my previous salary in SG job which is 130-140k.\n\n\n\nLogically, it would seem the managerial position fits the bill is it? Also, this is a safe choice if i plan to work abroad in the future. But weirdly, I wanted to take the US clients senior role and really work on my hobbies other goals for a planned exit.\n\n\n\nFor context, I took a break and I can feel the burn out for real. and it had me question everything... It is scary how i lost my will to strive in corporate life..\n\n\n\nAs I am planning exit in the industry, I want comments from the people who worked long in the industry, if is it worth it?? I have planned career map before and really had the grit to pursue it and i did and I know I can, but is it worth it?  Really... If so, how did you manage burn out? How did you find purpose in all this?\n\n\n\nFor those who exit, how is life.. please tell me it is better... and there is more to life than this career. Because now, if i take the managerial role in my previous job, it seems i am back to grinding and got no time for myself. If i take the US clients senior role, i have more time for myself as I have hobbies i want to improve on but career path is more uncertain (which doesn't matter as now I want to exit in the future, but can I really exit and have financial freedom)\n\n\n\nAm I just burn out now and needed some new perspective in corpo life?? I was burn out before over the years. I had breaktimes as well, but I did not lost my grit but now I do and it is scaryy how did I come to this point where corpo life is meaningless??\n\n\n\nI know the managerial role opportunity in my previous firm is a safe option and a pathway to moving abroad plan i have before which part of me wants...\n\nBut why does it not make sense to me..\n\nThe US firm senior role is have uncertain path forward but i have time for myself to work on hobbies and transition/exit out which is really really not what i planned before.. but somehow it's where i am leaning to.

I am confident in my abilities. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I worked hard to get where I am now but lately everything in the career ladder/corporate world seems meaningless... It is scary really how I lost all the grit I once had. I no longer want to work totally had I have financial freedom.. Probably because of working too long in the industry. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, I have been burn out that I don&amp;#39;t see myself working in the industry 5 years from now.. but the achiever in me don&amp;#39;t wanna just ditch this career i have worked so hard to get. I am planning if money is not the problem, maybe i could specialize in tax as I see the value we give to the client in tax, maybe 1 client would be enough for me just so I have put this career into purpose (i have tried applying for tax position but it did not push trough next phase after interview as I don&amp;#39;t have depth as I am more into audit over the years - i plan to (maybe) specialize in tax after exit in corporate life, maybe just 1 client)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But mainly i want a planned exit (Although Accounting is a prestigious job and for REAL I AM GRATEFUL to have options, however I feel like I have enough of the corporate life)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, of course i need to work and I cannot just easily stop working and work on meaningful hobbies only (as I have financial responsibilities - I have mortgage for my condo, i have built our family home in the province and plan to improve more, and i am helping with my sibling schooling)  I have been on work break for almost 3 months and I have been applying as well off course.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now I have this options I have been weighing on. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A) Managerial role in a big 4 firm (my previous work place)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They reached out with a salary of 140k for audit manager for the second time (this is confirmed i made sure).

Most of the trade school has a capacity of 18-20 students per intake and currently there are 140+ people on waiting list in bcit and ufv. I\u2019m willing to join any trade but they don\u2019t have admissions in any trades. Tried to apply for helper jobs but they are asking for foundational course. Trying to apply for part time jobs but can\u2019t get any. My E.I is done, savings finished. Applied for labour jobs in construction but they are saying right now even labour jobs are hard to find and many candidates with experience are struggling to get jobs. Seems like my only option is to go back to my previous software job but with the current job market and ai even those jobs are getting harder to get. What do I do now? Any suggestions or help is greatly appreciated. Is anyone else having similar problems?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "682e2d40-78e2-11ea-b9b2-0e4e69ee6911", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2t9i0", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#014980", "id": "1oji621", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DrinkIntelligent9691", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 2, "send_replies": true, "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/careerguidance/comments/1oji621/bc_sucks_right_now_and_its_draining_me_mentally/", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1oji621/bc_sucks_right_now_and_its_draining_me_mentally/", "subreddit_subscribers": 4720385, "created_utc": 1761775621.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "careerguidance", "selftext": "Hi guys, so I originally started out my career in sales and then pivoted internally to do marketing at my current job at an agency.

My degree was at a community college and it was in Technology Development and Management with a focus on Project management. I was able to land a job as an cellular sales rep at verizon a few months after graduating. I don't know if I should be sticking with this job for the long term and try to move up or if I should still be applying to other jobs while I work here. I make 34,500 salary and 16000 expected commission if I hit sales quota each month. They also have good insurance and benefits so it at least is keeping me afloat.

The Hiring Manager (HM) and executive boss have given strong signals, and the written offer is imminent this week. When the HM spoke to my former colleague that referred me after my second round interview, he told her \"I was polished and crushed it\".\u00a0\n\nThe Problem (The Risk): I anticipate a contingent offer that will require a background/credit check (standard for the industry). My compliance risk factors are severe:\u00a0\n\n1 Credit Score: Currently in the mid-400s (due to mass layoff and failed startup launch). Several accounts are in default.\u00a0\n\n2 Income Verification: I have a significant gap in W2/1099 income as I was involved in a start-up (post-layoff). The owner of the business was a former client and ask me to help him build the business out/scale it. There was a back and forth about bringing me on via W2 or 1099, and when the latter was offered, I made the mistake of thinking I'll sort that out later. There is a paper trail of payments via Zelle, personal check, Apple Pay, and possibly PayPal. He always offered and will be willing to do a verbal verification of employment (IE the background check company reaches him directly once it doesn't show a record as for W2 or 1099). I should've been more assertive here, but the plan for bringing me on in a formal manner was never properly executed. The original plan was for him to quit his W2 job and solely focus on the business ($1.5M in revenue in AV/IT) as of January 2025, but that timeline kept getting pushed back. He waffled with that and with some of the strategic initiatives I was rolling out. He will (per my last convo with him), probably quit current job in January 2026. I decided to stick out the startup because it gave me the opportunity to work on cool stuff like building out sales processes and strategy (I came up with the idea of rolling out AVaaS, which we are about to roll out). It also gave me the flexibility to work out some personal matters, as I valued healing instead of taking a job at a competitor I could've gotten in April/May 2024 at pay rate higher than the job that laid me off (and most of your division). I don't regret working the startup, what I learned was invaluable (I even self taught myself more about the industry and even landed a distributor/supplier for us organically on my own). This entrepreneurial approach to business is something I spoke on during the interview process and made me more attractive. My previous job was a similar role for a major national bank, and I passed background check with a score in the high 500s and low 600s.\u00a0\n\nMy Strategic Dilemma: I fear my offer will be pulled automatically if Compliance discovers the 400s score cold. I have executive support (the HM wants me).\u00a0\n\nMy Proposed Mitigation Strategy (Need Feedback): My plan is to NOT sign the contingent offer immediately, but instead:\u00a0\n\n1 Secure the written offer and accept it contingent on the check.\u00a0\n\n2 IMMEDIATELY call the Recruiter/HR (before the check is initiated).\u00a0\n\n3 Execute Pre-Emptive Disclosure: Explain the situation using an accountable narrative, tying the defaults and income gap directly to the mass layoff and the launch-phase instability of my venture.\u00a0\n\n4 Present a Plan of Action (POA): Commit to a formal, immediate repayment schedule/consolidation using the new salary, and offer to provide monthly status updates to HR/Compliance.\u00a0\n\nThe Question for Experienced Professionals:\u00a0\n\n1 Is this Pre-Emptive Disclosure strategy viable? Is bringing the HR rep into the loop before the check the only way to seek a Compliance exception? Is it best to wait until it comes up? Should I wait until after the offer is accepted but before the background check and explain to the background company. I've heard a mixed bag. I was thinking about waiting until it comes up as my layoff was 18 months ago, the beginning of a mass wave of layoffs across industries where this scenario is becoming more commonplace.\u00a0\n\n2 In your experience, what is the likelihood of a Compliance waiver/exception being granted for a high-value candidate (with executive sponsorship) when the default/debt is tied to a documented professional/economic dislocation, provided a clear POA is established?\u00a0\n\nAny non-judgmental, practical feedback from professionals in HR or regulated industries would be invaluable.

I joined while I was still in college as a part-timer and have grown with them as a graduate full-time employee. The first 2 years were various warehouse or data entry jobs but for the last 7 years I have been in sales. 4 years were in outside sales where I was building relationships up with minimal foundations and the past 3 years have been with one client in more of an account management role. I have build such a great relationship with the client that I don't really even have to sell to them anymore, they come to me for advice/solutions, no longer me hunting for it. Honestly, most sellers dream.\n\nCurrently with the position/relationship I have found myself in with this client, I feel I've become complacent to the sales cycle because of how easy it has become which is causing me to miss out on professional growth. Friends and prior sales coworkers who have moved to different departments within the company have climbed the ladder and are making big career impacts, all while I'm still in the same sales department I was in 7 years ago. Undoubtedly, I have grown vastly in my personal and business intelligence being in the various sales roles, it just feels like I'm being complacent.\n\nOver the past month or so I have been doing a lot of self reflection and thinking about what is next in my career. I've been with the same company and been in sales for the entire time I've been out of college. I always thought my next step for my career would be into sales leadership. 4 years ago I started planting that leadership seed when I reached out to my manager to find out what is looked for in a potential sales leader. Upon getting this list of things, I made a game plan to achieve those, of which I crushed all of them. Ultimately, a large team leader role came up a year after this conversation and I was passed up because I got out resumed by the other candidate. I could not hate because he was the better candidate for what the market needed at the time. I worked along side this employee as we were the same level and reported to the same manager he just had a team while I did not.\n\nFast forward to 3 weeks ago, the manager that was involved in all of this initial career growth conversations was more locations to add onto his territory. He now no longer has time to spend time with everyone on the team so he has created an assistant manager role and promoted up the person that out resumed me the first time. I now will be reporting to him. I feel bad as he is a great person but I can't get over the mental hurdle of the fact that he beat me, I then worked along side of him and now have to report to him. This is all while further delaying my potential leadership promotion. When I brought this up with the main manager who made all these moves he said that I \"just needed to be patient\", that I'm \"too much in my head\" \"overthinking hypotheticals and that \"the company is always growing and changing, I can move to a different part of the territory and start there\"\n\nCircling back to the self reflection, I thought that maybe sales leadership is not what I would be interested in. It's hard to motivate others to sell and hit goals when I can't seem to motivate myself to get that next promotion. I seem to only keep getting further and further away from the promotion. This got me thinking that if I'm not getting into sales leadership, and that I have a fear of becoming complacent in my sale, then what am I actually doing.\n\nThe cherry on top to this is one of my old coworkers at the company before I went to sales reached out to me earlier this week and asked me for the 3rd time in 18months to come join his team. This job would be in the supply chain/operations side of the business. When asked during the interview process about pay. I would have a salary more than what I get in my sales role with commission.

Now I'm in a rock and a hard place on whether or not I stay or goal.\n\nSome misc. thoughts I have:  \n\\- Even though this manager has passed me up for promotion I feel this blind loyalty to him and taking this new position if I accept it, would be disloyal of me  \n\\- I'm semi-fearful that staying in sales for much longer will hinder me because I will be stuck as just a sales person  \n\\- How do I get over this FOMO of my client.

Now I&amp;#39;m in a rock and a hard place on whether or not I stay or goal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some misc. thoughts I have:&lt;br/&gt;\n- Even though this manager has passed me up for promotion I feel this blind loyalty to him and taking this new position if I accept it, would be disloyal of me&lt;br/&gt;\n- I&amp;#39;m semi-fearful that staying in sales for much longer will hinder me because I will be stuck as just a sales person&lt;br/&gt;\n- How do I get over this FOMO of my client. I love what I do right now but like I said, I feel stagnate.&lt;br/&gt;\n- Am I stupid for considering leaving a gravy sales position?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the long post, I&amp;#39;m losing sleep over it and needed to vent!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "682e2d40-78e2-11ea-b9b2-0e4e69ee6911", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2t9i0", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#014980", "id": "1ojo62c", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DandyDapperness", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 1, "send_replies": true, "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/careerguidance/comments/1ojo62c/how_long_is_too_long_to_wait_and_be_patient/", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1ojo62c/how_long_is_too_long_to_wait_and_be_patient/", "subreddit_subscribers": 4720385, "created_utc": 1761791511.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "careerguidance", "selftext": "I work in IT as a data engineer, and with all the recent layoff news, I can\u2019t help but worry about how long I will last in the industry.

I was promoted to HSKP Supervisor back in March. Although it was the exact job I have already been doing the past 3 years, we were finally able to convince corporate to have the \u201csupervisor\u201d position created in order to actually compensate me fairly. I was doing MUCH more than my other hskp coworkers. (Side note: As a supervisor, I did not have any real authority. My direct manager handled all of that.) \n\nFast forward to a few days ago, my GM approached me about a job opening within our company. Our Front Desk Manager has found a new employer and that position will need to be filled soon. I have absolutely zero experience with front desk. I do have experience with the guests and other transferable skills. However, I have never had a desk job, never been in charge of other team members, been responsible for schedules, conflicts, etc. \n\nI am capable and adaptable. I do believe I can learn everything if I am given the appropriate tools, resources, and comprehensive training. \nThis would be a great opportunity for me. I have been wanting to get into some management role for a long time in order to start establishing a career. Our property is very small, so there\u2019s not a lot of room to grow. My GM and HSKP mgr are in full support. They believe in me. \n\nI am just concerned that with no experience, this is a very big undertaking. I don\u2019t want to be set up for failure. My biggest struggle is that I am usually extremely non-confrontational. I know that is not really an option if you want to be an effective leader. \n\nThere\u2019s also the fact that I know everyone at my workplace. Some of them are my friends. Transitioning into one of their managers seems very awkward. Luckily, our FD team is fairly new, so I don\u2019t have established relationships with them the way I do with the housekeepers. \n\nThis would be a huge stepping stone for me and my future. I just don\u2019t want to get this job, end up miserable, crash and burn. Also my schedule would change and I\u2019d have to work some nights, be available pretty much all the time, etc. (ugh lol) \n\n\nTL;DR: GM approached me about moving up within the company to a completely new department. I have zero experience, but my managers believe in me. Need advice about taking on a leadership role for the first time. \n\nQUESTIONS:\nSo, anyone that has taken on a leadership role without previous experience, please offer up any advice. What were your biggest struggles going into the role? What helped you grow? Did you ever have regrets? How do you deal with conflict, whether its customers/guests or your own team members? Were you younger than the employees you were managing? If so, how did you navigate that? \nOr any other general advice.

My direct manager handled all of that.) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to a few days ago, my GM approached me about a job opening within our company. Our Front Desk Manager has found a new employer and that position will need to be filled soon. I have absolutely zero experience with front desk. I do have experience with the guests and other transferable skills. However, I have never had a desk job, never been in charge of other team members, been responsible for schedules, conflicts, etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am capable and adaptable. I do believe I can learn everything if I am given the appropriate tools, resources, and comprehensive training. \nThis would be a great opportunity for me. I have been wanting to get into some management role for a long time in order to start establishing a career. Our property is very small, so there\u2019s not a lot of room to grow. My GM and HSKP mgr are in full support. They believe in me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am just concerned that with no experience, this is a very big undertaking. I don\u2019t want to be set up for failure. My biggest struggle is that I am usually extremely non-confrontational. I know that is not really an option if you want to be an effective leader. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There\u2019s also the fact that I know everyone at my workplace. Some of them are my friends. Transitioning into one of their managers seems very awkward. Luckily, our FD team is fairly new, so I don\u2019t have established relationships with them the way I do with the housekeepers. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This would be a huge stepping stone for me and my future. I just don\u2019t want to get this job, end up miserable, crash and burn. Also my schedule would change and I\u2019d have to work some nights, be available pretty much all the time, etc. (ugh lol) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: GM approached me about moving up within the company to a completely new department. I have zero experience, but my managers believe in me. Need advice about taking on a leadership role for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;QUESTIONS:\nSo, anyone that has taken on a leadership role without previous experience, please offer up any advice. What were your biggest struggles going into the role? What helped you grow? Did you ever have regrets? How do you deal with conflict, whether its customers/guests or your own team members? Were you younger than the employees you were managing? If so, how did you navigate that? \nOr any other general advice. Thank you! &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "682e2d40-78e2-11ea-b9b2-0e4e69ee6911", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2t9i0", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#014980", "id": "1ojdey3", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Chemical_Pen_7403", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 2, "send_replies": true, "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/careerguidance/comments/1ojdey3/my_gm_is_encouraging_me_to_apply_for_a_leadership/", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1ojdey3/my_gm_is_encouraging_me_to_apply_for_a_leadership/", "subreddit_subscribers": 4720385, "created_utc": 1761764604.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "careerguidance", "selftext": "**Hey everyone  Tim Madden here, CEO of Executive Career Upgrades.**  \nI\u2019m new to Reddit and wanted to share some real data and insights to help anyone currently in a job search.

Like now I won't ask my boss anything in person, only email so its documented (I don't work in an office/corporate type job, more in person thing).

I also am comfortable stepping up into a leader position and really enjoy it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There\u2019s more about me of course but I figured this could help you readers help me out with some sense of direction? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you!!! &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "682e2d40-78e2-11ea-b9b2-0e4e69ee6911", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2t9i0", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#014980", "id": "1ojl8h6", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ItzMaddie74", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 4, "send_replies": true, "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/careerguidance/comments/1ojl8h6/what_should_i_even_do_with_my_life/", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1ojl8h6/what_should_i_even_do_with_my_life/", "subreddit_subscribers": 4720385, "created_utc": 1761783339.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "careerguidance", "selftext": "Hi, I think the answer at first glance is chemical engineering because of a higher pay right after beginning to work, but I want to have a Masters degree too.
