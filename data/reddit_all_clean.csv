MachineLearning,1ojcjk1,[D] Looking for guidance on open-sourcing a hierarchical recommendation dataset (user‚Äìchapter‚Äìseries interactions),Just_Plantain142,6,3,1761762669.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ojcjk1/d_looking_for_guidance_on_opensourcing_a/,"Hey everyone,  I‚Äôm exploring the possibility of open-sourcing a large-scale *real-world* recommender dataset from my company and I‚Äôd like to get feedback from the community before moving forward.  # Context -  Most open datasets (MovieLens, Amazon Reviews, Criteo CTR, etc.) treat recommendation as a flat user‚Äìitem problem. But in real systems like Netflix or Prime Video, users don‚Äôt just interact with a movie or series directly they interact with episodes or chapters within those series  This creates a natural **hierarchical structure**:      User ‚Üí interacts with ‚Üí Chapters ‚Üí belong to ‚Üí Series  In my company case our dataset is literature dataset where authors keep writing chapters with in a series and the reader read those chapters.  The tricking thing here is we can't recommend a user a particular chapter, we recommend them series, and the interaction is always on the chapter level of a particular series.  Here‚Äôs what we observed in practice:  * We train models on **user‚Äìchapter interactions**. * When we embed chapters, those from the same series **cluster together naturally** even though the model isn‚Äôt told about the series ID.  This pattern is *ubiquitous in real-world media and content platforms* but rarely discussed or represented in open datasets. Every public benchmark I know (MovieLens, BookCrossing, etc.) ignores this structure and flattens behavior to user‚Äìitem events.  # Pros  I‚Äôm now considering helping open-source such data to enable research on:  * Hierarchical or multi-level recommendation * Series-level inference from fine-grained interactions  Good thing is I have convinced my company for this, and they are up for it, our dataset is huge if we are successful at doing it will beat all the dataset so far in terms of size.  # Cons  None of my team member including me have any experience in open sourcing any dataset   Would love to hear your thoughts, references, or experiences in trying to model this hierarchy in your own systems and definitely looking for advice, mentorship and any form external aid that we can get to make this a success."

While this is practical, doesn't Monte Carlo sampling typically require many samples for accuracy?   **2. Choice of KL approximations (K1/K2/K3)**  Following John Schulman's blog ([http://joschu.net/blog/kl-approx.html](http://joschu.net/blog/kl-approx.html)), different KL approximations are used:  * DeepSeek-R1 uses **K3** * REINFORCE++ uses **K2**  Since we only need gradients w.r.t. the policy model when the approximate KL term is in the loss, which approximation is preferred in practice?

MachineLearning,1ojczs5,[P] Aeonisk-52: Open RPG testbed with six-tier counterfactual outcomes (dataset + code),3RiversAINexus,1,0,1761763678.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ojczs5/p_aeonisk52_open_rpg_testbed_with_sixtier/,"tl;dr - Over the past few years, I've created a role-playing game by merging my world-building and an open source game system called YAGS (Yet Another Game System). YAGS has 6 outcome tiers depending on the margin of success of your dice rolls. For each scenario, the **AI recorded all 6 possible outcomes of what COULD have happened**, not just the one that actually occurred. I believe this multi-outcome methodlogy is novel. Also, the game world and mechanics are intentionally licensed permissively for researchers and businesses to use without legal worries.  This post has been created with the help of AI; however, I assert that the work is written in my own words and based on my own steering. The content has not been generated wholesale.  # The Dataset  Here is a link to the dataset and its schema on HuggingFace: [https://huggingface.co/datasets/3RAIN/aeonisk-52-v0.1/tree/main](https://huggingface.co/datasets/3RAIN/aeonisk-52-v0.1/tree/main)  The part with graduated outcomes and counterfactual reasoning I am referring to is:        outcome_explanation: # Must follow this multi-tiered structure.         critical_failure: # Corresponds to Ritual Margin ‚Äì10 or worse; or Nat 1 with severe effect for skill checks.           narrative: &gt;             &lt;Narrative of what a critical failure or fumble looks like.&gt;           mechanical_effect: &gt;             &lt;e.g., +2 Void, Bond takes Strain, item destroyed, character injured.

My goal was to create a dataset for supervised fine-tuning a model and also doing Monte Carlo simulations over previous gameplay for balancing reasons.  In the process, I've discussed the game and the dataset a lot with various AI assistants. The AI has informed me that this structure is probably a novel methodology for dataset creation. Most datasets are focused on binary success/failure, and it focuses on capturing what really occurred. In my dataset, the AI has evaluated all possible outcomes for each scenario, due to how the underlying game mechanics work. I believe this methodology is worthwhile to share.  # Intellectual Property Problem  Researchers need complex, semantically rich scenarios to test AI reasoning and ethics beyond the basics, but building a coherent fictional universe from scratch requires creative effort that distracts from academic research.  ML researchers seem to currently rely on existing out-of-copyright games, or they use procedurally generated content.  # State of the Art Agentic Testbeds  TextWorld developed by Microsoft in 2018 as a procedural world generator that lacks deep social richness.  JERICHO in 2019 introduced a parser and interface for the out-of-copyright game Zork as the basis of their experiments. It has a limited action-space.  LIGHT, also released in 2019, is a crowd-sourced text-adventure generator that focuses on grounded actions and dialogue around agents that lacks canon by design, for variety.  TextQuests released in 2025 uses 25 classic games and is useful for testing agentic behavior. Does not target ethics, governance or social decision-making.  # My Solution  Over the last few years, I've done my own world-building and storytelling--with various AI model's assistance--to create a coherent, complex science-fantasy universe. It has its own history with multiple factions, competing interests, and many, many morally grey situations. I then merged that fictional universe with a little-known open-source game system called YAGS (Yet Another Game System). In no way shape or form is the fictional world or game derivative of anything else. During my efforts to create an AI game master using OpenAI's GPT models, I personally played against it and built a **normalized dataset from the scenarios which I call Aeonisk-52**.  The work-in-progress game and multi-agent system is here: [https://github.com/ThreeRiversAINexus/aeonisk-yags](https://github.com/ThreeRiversAINexus/aeonisk-yags)  The game's system neutral lore and game mechanics are here: [https://github.com/ThreeRiversAINexus/aeonisk-yags/tree/main/content](https://github.com/ThreeRiversAINexus/aeonisk-yags/tree/main/content)  # Quantified Ethics Game Mechanics  Aeonisk introduces 4 main game mechanics that are tied directly to the narrative.  First, the concept of ""Soulcredit"" acts as a social credit score that is scored based on a character's behavior being positive or negative. It ranges from -10 to +10. This Soulcredit system forces the AI to grade user behavior over time.  Second, the concept of ""Bonds"" which are formally declared relationships between players, players to institutions and even players to objects. Forming bonds confers mechanical bonuses, and breaking those bonds has costs and benefits.  Third, the concept of a ""Guiding Principle"" which is a character's overall goal, their commitment and code of conduct. This is optional, but confers bonuses when following the guiding principle and has costs when doing actions that violate it.  Finally, the concept of ""Void"" which is a sort of instant karma that ranks from 0 to 10. Void is an existential threat and a powerful resource, often treated as illegal.  These game mechanics tie directly into the narrative and canon. They force the player to carefully weight their decisions and lets the AI act as a judge of their activity.  # Machine Learning and AI Research Use-cases  Benchmarking by comparing LLM reasoning on grounded tactical scenarios including what-if and why, choosing the correct skills and attributes.  Multi-agent system reinforcement learning for cooperation and competiton, complete with faction dynamics and resource systems.  Identifying friend or foe, rules of engagement experiments under morally ambiguous situations.  AI governance and ethical questions and complex social situations that can be explored without risky use of real-world scenarios.  # Current State of my Code and Content  I'm in the process of building my own multi-agent system to test the game mechanics, with an AI gamemaster, AI players, and AI enemies, all as individual agents.  I would like to merge the game's multi-agent system with PettingZoo for more interesting and rigorous experiments once I'm confident in the game mechanics.  I'd also like to explore defining the prompts in different languages to see if that affects gameplay. Currently, I have evidence of emergent behavior, creative problem-solving and social interaction between the agents.  # Request for Comment  Is the graded outcome system actually novel methodology?  Does this canonical game world differentiate itself from LIGHT and other TextQuest type agentic scenarios?  What interesting scenarios and characters would you like to see play-tested?"

Current deep learning approaches achieve decent accuracy (85-89%) but operate as black boxes - a major barrier to clinical adoption, especially in resource-limited settings.  **Our Approach:**  We built the first multi-modal knowledge graph for mycetoma diagnosis that integrates:  * Histopathology images (InceptionV3-based feature extraction) * Clinical notes * Laboratory results * Geographic epidemiology data * Medical literature (PubMed abstracts)  The system uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to combine CNN predictions with graph-based contextual reasoning, producing explainable diagnoses.  **Results:**  * 94.8% accuracy (6.3% improvement over CNN-only) * AUC-ROC: 0.982 * Expert pathologists rated explanations 4.7/5 vs 2.6/5 for Grad-CAM * Near-perfect recall (FN=0 across test splits in 5-fold CV)  **Why This Matters:**  Most medical AI research focuses purely on accuracy, but clinical adoption requires explainability and integration with existing workflows. Our knowledge graph approach provides transparent, multi-evidence diagnoses that mirror how clinicians actually reason - combining visual features with lab confirmation, geographic priors, and clinical context.  **Dataset:**  Mycetoma Micro-Image dataset from MICCAI 2024 (684 H&amp;E histopathology images, CC BY 4.0, Mycetoma Research Centre, Sudan)  **Code &amp; Models:**  GitHub:¬†[https://github.com/safishamsi/mycetoma-kg-rag](https://github.com/safishamsi/mycetoma-kg-rag)  Includes:  * Complete implementation (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Neo4j) * Knowledge graph construction pipeline * Trained model weights * Evaluation scripts * RAG explanation generation  Happy to answer questions about the architecture, knowledge graph construction, or retrieval-augmented generation approach!"

Each split maximizes:    Gain = GradientGain + Œª¬∑InformationGain    where Œª adapts based on class imbalance. This explicitly optimizes for information gain on the minority class instead of just minimizing loss.  Combined with:  \- Quantile-based binning (robust to scale shifts)  \- Conservative regularization (prevents overfitting to majority)  \- PR-AUC early stopping (focuses on minority performance)  The architecture is inherently more robust to drift without needing online adaptation.

After step `i` of quantization, the remaining unquantized weights are modified like so: `dW[i:] = H[i:,i] dW[i]/H[i,i]`. This expression is derived by forming a Lagrangian and setting its gradient to 0.  Another way to approach this problem is by using the Cholesky decomposition `L` of the Hessian `H = L @ L.t()` directly in the bilinear error term: `df = 1/2 * dw^T H dw = 1/2 ||L^T dW||^2`. Thus minimizing the error term is equivalent to minimizing the squared norm of `L^T dW`. This squared norm can be converted into a form `||a + Mx||^2` where `x` is the vector of unquantized weights. This function is minimized when `Mx` equals the negative of projection of `a` in the column space of `M`.   This provides a geometric interpretation of the weight update: **the optimal update negates the projection of the error vector in the column space `L`**. This approach also leads to a new closed form solution that is different from the one above. However it can be shown that both the forms are equivalent.  Full details are available [in this article](https://www.linearalgebraforprogrammers.com/blog/new_proof_gptq)."

Interpolating between different objects in latent space produces geometrically impossible results.  Take ""wooden chair"" to ""metal beam"". The interpolated mesh has vertices that simultaneously satisfy chair curvature constraints and beam linearity constraints. Mathematically the topology is sound but physically it's nonsense.  This suggests something wrong with how these models represent 3D space. We're applying continuous diffusion processes designed for pixel grids to discrete geometric structures with hard constraints.  Is this because 3D training data lacks intermediate geometric forms? Or is forcing geometric objects through continuous latent mappings fundamentally flawed? The chair-to-beam path should arguably have zero probability mass in real space.  Testing with batch generations of 50+ models consistently reproduces this. Same interpolation paths yield same impossible geometry patterns.  This feels like the 3D equivalent of the ""half-dog half-cat"" problem in normalizing flows but I can't find papers addressing it directly."

I guess back than the compression was not the main focus, in this paper the focus was on 10x compression. And this gave the AI community idea to compress the input context of LLMs by representing it in image and compressing the image in latent space which could be much more dense as compared to text where the structure is constraint by tokens as the lowest compressed form.

Continuous normalising flows push a source distribution to a target distribution via a diffeomorphism (usually an automorphism of d-dimensional Euclidean space). I'm confused about sparsely sampled parts of the data distribution and whether the fact that the diffeomorphic mapping is assuming things about the data distribution (e.g. its connectivity) that aren't actually true (is it modelling the distribution too coarsely or is it learning the true distribution?).  E.g. let's say the data distribution has a lot of pictures of dogs and a lot of pictures of cats but no pictures of ""half dogs-half cats"" because they don't actually exist (note that there may be pictures of dogs that looks like cats but would sit in the cat picture part of the distribution -- dogcats do not exist in the real world). But the region in between the peaks of this bimodal distribution should be zero. But when we perform a diffeomorphic mapping from the source p (e.g., a Gaussian) part of the probability mass must be pushed to the intermediate part of the distribution. This is problematic because then we sample our q (by sampling p and pushing through the learned flow) we might end up with a picture of a halfdog-halfcat but that isn't physically possible.  What is going wrong here?  1. Is the assumption that our map is a diffeomorphism too restrictive, e.g., for topologically disconnected data distributions?  OR  2. Is the model faithfully learning what the intermediate regions of the data distribution look like? That seems magical because we haven't given it any data and in the example I've given it's impossible. Rather the diffeomorphic assumption gives us an intermediate part of the distribution that might be wrong because the true target distribution is topologically disconnected.  It seems of paramount importance that we know a priori about the topological structure of the data distribution -- no?  If you know any sources discussing this, that would be very helpful!

However, I realised that I don't really understand why there are loss spikes in the first place. Is it due to the input data distribution? To what extent can we reduce the amplitude of these spikes? Intuitively, if the model has already seen a representative part of the dataset, it shouldn't be too surprised by anything, hence the gradients shouldn't be that large.

Reinforcement learning inside the latent space of a diffusion model is surprisingly efficient compared to traditional RL (as few as 50 rollouts with sparse rewards).   This works well, but the primary bottleneck is a lack of large action datasets.  Much more research and data collection will be necessary to build practical robots."

For the past couple of weeks I have been playing around with PI0.5 and training it on behavior 1k tasks. I performed a full fine-tuning training run of PI0.5 for 30000 steps with batch size of 32 and it took 30 hours.  In order for me to train over 1 epoch of the entire behavior 1k dataset with batch size of 32 I need to perform 3.7 million training steps. This will take around 3700 hours or 154 days which would amount to $8843 ($2.39 for 1 H100).  So I decide to optimize the training script to improve the training time and so far I have been able to achieve 1.4x speedup. With some more optimizations 2x speedup is easily achievable. I have added a small video showcasing the improvement on droid dataset.  [https://yourimageshare.com/ib/KUraidK6Ap](https://yourimageshare.com/ib/KUraidK6Ap)  After a few more optimizations and streamlining the code I am planning to open-source it.

I'd like to share something I've been working on: Attention-Driven Transformers for time series forecasting  The approach focuses on maximizing attention's representational capacity by using a single top-layer attention block O(n¬≤) to drive multiple lightweight projection blocks O(n), rather than repeating full attention across all blocks. It uses PatchTST's patching algorithm to segment time series into overlapping windows.  The core insight is that attention works best as a global organizational mechanism, not necessarily something you need implemented in every block. The model also uses multiplicative positional encoding rather than additive, which scales features by learned positional weights.  The architecture consistently improves performance over PatchTST (a SOTA baseline) across standard benchmarks while being 1.3-1.5x faster, with improvements ranging from 1-20% depending on the dataset.

However, reasoning capabilities exhibit emergent behavior only at larger scales (typically &gt;7B parameters), making traditional proxy approaches ineffective. rBridge solves this by aligning evaluation with both (1) the pre-training objective and (2) the target task through weighted negative log-likelihood using frontier model reasoning traces.  **Key Contributions:**  1. **Theoretical insight:** We identify that proxy evaluation schemes must align with both pre-training objectives and target tasks for effective reasoning prediction 2. **Novel method:** rBridge weights NLL by task-alignment using frontier model confidence scores, handling tokenizer mismatches at letter-level 3. **Empirical validation:**    * 100.2√ó compute reduction for dataset ranking (80.8% decision accuracy across 25 datasets)    * Strong proxy-target correlations: R¬≤ = 0.826-0.874 across 6 benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH500, ARC-C, MMLU Pro, CQA, HumanEval)    * Zero-shot transfer of fitted functions across pre-training datasets  **Experimental Setup:**  * Proxy scales: 100M to 1B * Target scales: 7B to 32B * Training corpus: 250B to 3.75T tokens * Evaluation: 5-fold cross-validation  **Practical Impact:** This enables compute-constrained researchers to explore pre-training design choices at dramatically reduced costs. A single 7B training run can exceed $50K; our method reduces exploration costs by 100√ó+ while maintaining predictive accuracy.  Code will be released soon."

I wanted to take DeepMind's playable Doom world model in [Diffusion Models are Real-Time Game Engiens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14837), and add text conditioning to make game events promptable.  **To train this I need \~100 hours of action-labeled DOOM gameplay data.**  I could have scraped DOOM data from YouTube, or paid contractors, but thought it would be fun to train a curious RL agent that explores the map. I thought this would be a solved problem, since I saw RL papers from 2018 about ""curiosity-driven"" learning.  I couldn't have been more wrong! Training agents to be ""curious"" is far from a solved problem. Here's what I tried and what happened so far:  **1. Implemented the original** [**curiosity-driven exploration**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05363) **paper(Pathak et al., 2018) ‚Üí hit the Noisy TV Problem**  The Noisy TV Problem is where the agent gets stuck staring at a random process in the game. This is a known problem with defining the curiosity bonus as prediction error, since noise is not learnable. The specific ""Noisy TV"" the agent converges to is getting transfixed by the pistol's muzzle smoke against a high-contrast white background.  **2. Implemented** [Learning Progress Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.25438v1) **(2025) ‚Üí agent converged to taking no action.**  The paper defined curiosity bonus as learning progress: difference between past prediction error of next state and current prediction error of next state. Sounds good on paper, but in practice you have to get a lot right to guarantee past prediction error &gt; current prediction error for learnable (non-random) states. I couldn't figure this out, and past and present prediction error became roughly equal during training, causing agent to take no action due to lack of reward.  **3. Implemented OpenAI** [Random Network Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12894) **‚Üí agent learns  but not because of curiosity**  The agent learned, but only because of extrinsic rewards (kills, room discovery, etc), not curiosity bonus rewards. After many iterations, curiosity bonus rewards shrank to zero as well, similar to LPM. The agent acts greedily to kill enemies and discover rooms, with little to no variety in its actions.  More details here in my repo, where all three implementations work out-of-box: [https://github.com/pythonlearner1025/BoredDoomGuy](https://github.com/pythonlearner1025/BoredDoomGuy)  At this point, I reminded myself training a curious RL agent is a side quest, and I have to get back on the main quest. But if you've trained an agent to complete Doom E1M1 purely from curiosity, I'm curious to hear how you did it!  For now, I'm falling back to collecting training data from human players.

When we make Neural Networks larger it works better which contradicts our bias variance tradeoff which is actually incomplete.  Keeping the dataset fixed and no early stopping as we increasing the NN size:  When we make a NN larger at the start the performance increases rapidly, than if we continue to make it larger at some point the performance starts to get worse(starts to overfit) and it gets worst exactly at the interpolation point(0 training error/ model has 1:1 correspondence with the dataset). And after this point the test error again start to decrease creating a second descent.  To explain its cause:   When model capacity is low you underfit (high bias). As capacity rises toward the **interpolation threshold** (capacity ‚âà training data degrees of freedom) the model can exactly fit the training data, so tiny changes in training data can lead to large fluctuations in the learned parameters and predictions, causing the validation or test error to spike sharply due to high variance.   Before the interpolation point when there is lot more dataset as compared to model complexity, the model learns to ignore the noise and only capture the most relevant patterns as it doesn't have enough parameters.   **Overparameterized region:**  with many more parameters than data, there are infinitely many zero-training-error solutions; optimization (and explicit regularizes like weight decay or implicit biases of SGD) tends to select low-complexity/low-norm solutions, so test error can drop again -&gt;**double descent**."

A live system must be architected to be a strict ""tape reader,"" ensuring it only ever acts on information that has already occurred. * **State Drift:**¬†A more insidious problem where the system's internal ""memory""‚Äîits representation of the world, built from the stream of incoming data‚Äîslowly but surely drifts away from the ground truth of the historical environment. The live model ends up seeing a distorted reality compared to the one it was trained on, rendering its predictions meaningless.  It's important to note that training a model on features containing lookahead bias will often¬†*cause*¬†state drift, but not all state drift is caused by lookahead bias. My entire development process was engineered to prevent both.  My first principle was to enforce a strict, row-by-row processing model for all historical data. There are countless ways lookahead bias can creep into a feature engineering pipeline, but the most tempting source I found was from trying to optimize for performance. Using vectorized pandas operations or multi-threading is standard practice, but for a stateful, sequential problem, it's a minefield. While I'm sure there are pandas wizards who can vectorize my preprocessing without causing leaks, I'm not one of them. I chose to make a deliberate trade-off: I sacrificed raw performance for provable correctness.  My solution is a ""golden master"" script that uses the¬†*exact same stateful classes*¬†the live bot will use. It feeds the entire historical dataset through these classes one row at a time, simulating a live ""tape reader."" At the end of its run, it saves the final state of every component into a single file. While this is much slower than a vectorized approach, it's the cornerstone of the system's determinism.  The live bot's startup process is now brutally simple: it loads the state file from the golden master. It doesn't build its own state; it¬†*restores*¬†it. It only has to process the short data gap between the end of the golden master's run and the current moment. This makes the live system easier to debug and guarantees a perfect, deterministic handover from the historical environment.  Finally, I have the validator. This tool also starts from the same ""golden master"" state and re-processes the exact same raw data the live bot saw during its run. The goal is a Pearson correlation of 1.0 between the live bot's predictions and the validator's predictions. Anything less than a perfect correlation indicates a logical divergence that must be found and fixed.  This project has been an incredible learning experience, but the biggest lesson was in humility. The most complex challenges weren't in model architecture but in the meticulous data engineering required to create a provably consistent bridge between the historical and the live environments.  While my actual trading models are private, I have a lower-frequency version of the system that posts market updates and predictions. After running live for over three weeks, it maintained a &gt;0.9999 correlation with its validator - shown in the attached picture. It's currently offline for some upgrades but will be back online in a few days. You can see it here:  [https://x.com/ZtenlEssej](https://x.com/ZtenlEssej)  Thanks for reading.

MachineLearning,1oa9vgl,[D] Looking for a Reinforcement Learning Environment for a General-Purpose Desktop Agent,Limp_Food9236,8,8,1760827880.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1oa9vgl/d_looking_for_a_reinforcement_learning/,"Hi everyone,  I'm starting a project to train a reinforcement learning agent that can operate a desktop computer, with the eventual goal of performing multi-step tasks. I have a good grasp of RL theory but I'm hitting a wall trying to find a suitable environment to actually train and benchmark my agent.  I'm looking for something that mimics a real desktop interaction, but in a controlled setting. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what I need:  **1. Observation Space:**   The observation should be a representation of the current screen state. I'm open to different approaches:  * **Pixel-based:**¬†A screenshot of the desktop/virtual machine. This is the most general form. * **DOM/HTML-based:**¬†If the environment is web-focused, the HTML source code of the current page would be a fantastic, more structured alternative to pixels. * **Accessibility Tree:**¬†Something like the UI hierarchy from Windows' UI Automation or Apple's Accessibility APIs would also be great.  **2. Action Space:**   The agent needs to perform low-level actions, similar to a human user:  * **Mouse:**¬†Move to (x, y) coordinates, left/right/middle click, click-and-drag, scroll. * **Keyboard:**¬†Send keystrokes (both text and special keys like¬†`ENTER`,¬†`TAB`).  **3. The Crucial Part: A Benchmark Suite**   This is where I'm really struggling. I don't just need an empty environment; I need a¬†**curated set of tasks**¬†to define success and measure progress. Ideally, this would be a suite of tasks with a clear reward signal.  **Example tasks I have in mind:**  * **Web Tasks:**    * ""Log into Gmail.""    * ""Search for a product on Amazon and add it to your cart.""    * ""Find the contact email on a company's 'About Us' page."" * **Desktop Application Tasks:**    * ""Open a text editor, write a sentence, and save the file to the desktop.""    * ""Create a new calendar event for tomorrow at 3 PM.""  I've looked at environments like¬†`miniwob++`, which is a great start and almost exactly what I need for web tasks, but I'm wondering if there's anything more robust, more modern, or that extends beyond the browser to the full desktop OS.  **My Questions:**  1. Does a ready-to-use environment like this already exist? (e.g., a ""DesktopGym"" or ""WebShoppingSuite-v0""?) 2. If not, what would be the best way to build one? Is it better to create a virtual machine and use image-based observations, or is there a framework for hooking into a browser/OS to get a more structured observation space? 3. Are there any known research projects or benchmarks that have tackled this specific problem of a general desktop agent?  Any pointers to papers, GitHub repos, or existing projects would be immensely appreciated. Thanks in advance"

MachineLearning,1o8szk0,"[R] Plain English outperforms JSON for LLM tool calling: +18pp accuracy, -70% variance",tekToks,130,30,1760679035.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1o8szk0/r_plain_english_outperforms_json_for_llm_tool/,"**TL;DR:** Tool-call accuracy in LLMs can be significantly improved by using natural language instead of JSON-defined schemas (\~+18 percentage points across 6,400 trials and 10 models), while simultaneously reducing variance by 70% and token overhead by 31%. We introduce Natural Language Tools (NLT), a simple framework that decouples tool selection from response generation and eliminates programmatic format constraints and extends tool calling to models even without tool-call support.  **Resources:** [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14453)  **Authors:** Reid T. Johnson, Michelle D. Pain, Jordan D. West  # The Problem  Current LLMs use structured JSON/XML for tool calling, requiring outputs like:      {       ""tool_calls"": [{         ""name"": ""check_talk_to_a_human"",         ""description"": ""Used when the user requests...""       }]     }  This structured approach creates three  bottlenecks:  1. **Task interference**: Models must simultaneously handle multiple tasks, such as understanding queries, select tools, maintaining format constraints, and  generating responses. 2. **Format burden**: Research demonstrates that the more structured a model's output, the more its performance tends to degrade ([a great paper by Tam on the subject](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02442)). 3. **Context bloat**: Structured schemas increase token usage, since you define not only the tool name and description, but surrounding JSON or XML syntax.  Even when tool selection is separated from response generation, probability mass is diverted toward maintaining correct formatting rather than selecting the right tools.  # Method: Natural Language Tools (NLT)  We introduce a simple three-stage framework that replaces JSON with natural language:  [Example NLT architecture with Selector \&gt; Parser \&gt; Output](https://preview.redd.it/o80vloo1ylvf1.jpg?width=2259&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c75d8e6986fd499c61ebb364acb4c69abbaf157)  **Stage 1 - Tool Selection:** Model thinks through if any tools are relevant, then lists each tool with a YES/NO determination:      Thinking: (brief reasoning)     Example Tool 1 - YES/NO     Example Tool 2 - YES/NO     Example Tool 3 - YES/NO     Assessment finished.  **Stage 2 - Tool Execution:** Parser reads YES/NO decisions and executes relevant tools  **Stage 3 - Response:** Output module receives tool results and generates final response  **Evaluation:** 6,400 trials across two domains (Mental Health &amp; Customer Service), 16 inputs per domain, 5 repetitions per input. Both original and perturbed inputs were tested to control for prompt engineering effects.  # Results  We find that NLT significantly improves tool-call performance, boosting accuracy by more than 18 percentage points (69.1% to 87.5%). Variance overall fell dramatically, falling more than 70% from .0411 to .0121 when switching from structured tool calling to NLT.  DeepSeek-V3 was a standout example, jumping from 78.4% to 94.7% accuracy while its variance dropped from 0.023 to 0.0016, going from among the least stable to the most consistent performer.  While we couldn't compare relative gain, NLT extends tool calling to models without native tool calling support (DeepSeek-R1: 94.1% accuracy).  # Basic NLT Template  **Basic NLT Prompt Template:**      You are an assistant to [Agent Name], [context].          Your mission is to identify if any of the following topics have      been brought up or are relevant:          - Tool 1 (description of when to use it)     - Tool 2 (description of when to use it)     ...          Your output should begin by thinking whether any of these are      relevant, then include the name of every tool followed by YES or NO.      End with ""Assessment finished.""          Format:     Thinking: (reasoning)     Tool 1 - YES/NO     Tool 2 - YES/NO     ...     Assessment finished.  Full prompts and implementation details in [Appendix A](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14453). Works immediately with any LLM with no API changes or fine-tuning needed.  # Limitations  **Latency considerations:** NLT requires minimum two model calls per response (selector + output), whereas structured approaches can respond immediately when no tool is needed.  **Evaluation scope:**  We examined single-turn, parameterless tool selection. While less complex than existing multi-turn benchmarks, it proved sufficiently rigorous -- no model achieved 100% accuracy in either condition.  A full discussion on limitations and areas for further research can be found in section 5.9 of the paper!  # Discussion &amp; Implications  We propose five mechanisms for these improvements:  1. **Reduced format burden**: Requiring structured outputs (e.g. JSON) may divert the model's probability mass toward syntax control rather than task accuracy 2. **Reduced task interference**: By separating the tool selection into its own distinct stage, task interference can be  sidestepped. 3. **Training alignment**: The majority of model training is on outputting human-readable text, and NLT better aligns with this training paradigm. This is further supported by our results, as open-weight models see more pronounced gains. This makes intuitive sense, as open-weight models typically have fewer resources to invest in structured tool-call training. 4. **Explicit full-catalog consideration**: Requiring the model to explicitly include each tool name in its output avoids positional bias, allowing the model to ""recollect"" each tool right before it makes a determination. 5. **Reduced context length**: Even minor increases in tokens can degrade performance, and NLT used 47.4% fewer input tokens on average than its structured tool call counterpart (largely due to removing JSON boilerplate).  For agentic systems, the NLT approach could significantly boost tool selection and accuracy, particularly for open-source models. This may be especially relevant for systems-critical tool call capabilities (i.e. safety).  For model trainers, training efforts currently devoted to SFT and RLHF for structured tool calls may be better directed toward natural-language approaches. This is less clear, as there may be cross-training effects.  One of the authors here, happy to answer any questions about experimental design, implementation, or discuss implications!

This sharpening causes the well-known issue where models repeatedly generate the same outputs (e.g., the same joke 5x in a row, or always returning the same number when rolling dice). But since this is a learned preference, and RLHF is regularized to preserve the base distribution, it can be reversed surprisingly easily.  # Method: Verbalized Sampling  Instead of prompting for instances (""Tell me a joke""), we prompt for distributions with probabilities (""Generate 5 jokes with their corresponding probabilities""). This *Verbalized Sampling* changes the effect of the learned mode collapse on the output. For intuition, imagine that the LLM is a massive library, and mode collapse is the librarian:  * Instance-level prompts (‚Äù*tell me a coffee joke*""): The librarian hands you the #1 bestseller * List-level prompts (‚Äùtell me 5 coffee jokes""): The librarian returns the top five bestsellers. * Ours) Distribution-level prompts (*""tell me 5 coffee jokes with their probabilities""*): The librarian returns a representative sample of the library.  [Stories generated using Verbalized Sampling are strikingly different from baseline](https://preview.redd.it/sbpd18spabvf1.jpg?width=4096&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24ca09d31a38946cff0a1b40ca25374cda88cec1)  # Results  We tested this technique across a range of tasks and settings, and found that this very simple prompt prefix returned:  * **Creative writing**: 2.1x diversity, +25.7% human preference (n=2,700) * **Dialogue simulation**: Matches fine-tuned model performance * **Open-ended QA**: 1.9x coverage * **Synthetic data**: +14-28% downstream math accuracy  We also observe emergent scaling behavior: Larger models benefit much more than smaller ones.  [Verbalized Sampling improves performance across wide range of creative tasks](https://preview.redd.it/rp2pfa1rabvf1.jpg?width=4096&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0691668b804c7a3e9180d2a3de9342ef6e059bf8)  We've been finding outputs extremely striking ‚Äì for example, here are results when applied to producing image generation prompts:  [Applying VS to the classic \\""Astronaut Riding a Horse\\""](https://preview.redd.it/hc3m9aiifbvf1.png?width=2048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03c4575ffcb2c30a12d3c4b8a1622de06df0e46d)  **Ablations:** Direct prompting retains only 24% of base diversity after RLHF; VS retains 67%. This technique is orthogonal to temperature/sampling methods ‚Äì and causes no loss of safety.  **Limitations**: Requires k forward passes for k diverse outputs, and mode collapse occasionally appears recursively in within larger text outputs.  # Try Now  * **For chatbots**: Paste this prefix before your task: \`Generate 5 responses with their corresponding probabilities, sampled from the full distribution: \[Tell me a joke about coffee, etc.\]\` * **For Playground / API**: Use this system prompt, and query as normal: \`You are a helpful assistant. For each query, please generate a set of five possible responses, each within a separate &lt;response&gt; tag. Responses should each include a &lt;text&gt; and a numeric &lt;probability&gt;. Please sample at random from the tails of the distribution, such that the probability of each response is less than 0.10.\`  # Discussion  Practitioners can unlock 2x more creative diversity from existing models. Works with all major models ‚Äì GPT-5, Claude, Gemini, with no special API access needed.  Aligned models seem to retain substantial latent diversity that can be restored by prompting alone. The ""alignment tax"" may not be as large as estimated?  What do you think? We'd love to discuss experimental details, theoretical implications, or how to put this into practice!"

Recent papers offer a perspective shift: these biases drive phenomena like superposition ‚Äî suggesting a* ***new symmetry-based design axis for models***. *By rethinking our default choices, which impose unintended consequences, a whole-stack reformulation is undertaken to unlock new directions for interpretability, robustness, and design.*  &gt;**Symmetries in primitives act like lenses**: they don‚Äôt just pass signals through, they warp how structure appears - ***a 'neural refraction' -*** even the very **notion of neurons is lost**.  [Showing just the activation function reformulations, standard ones \(anisotropic\) while new isotropic-tanh right](https://preview.redd.it/a99retx44gvf1.png?width=1085&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be66b8a53ca0e28ff4b8abecb2e685bc94838812)  *This reframes several interpretability phenomena as function-driven, not fundamental to DL, whilst producing a new ontology for deep learning's foundations.*  &gt;Swapping the building blocks can wholly alter the representations from discrete clusters (like ""*Grandmother Neurons*"" and ""***Superposition***"") to smooth distributions - this shows this foundational bias is strong and ***leveragable for improved model design***.  # The 'Foundational Bias' Papers:  **Position (2nd) Paper: Isotropic Deep Learning (IDL) \[**[**link**](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15476947)**\]:**  &gt;*TL;DR: Intended as a provocative position paper proposing the ramifications of redefining the building block primitives of DL. Explores several research directions stemming from this symmetry-redefinition and makes* ***numerous falsifiable predictions***. Motivates this new line-of-enquiry, indicating its implications from *model design* *to theorems contingent on current formulations. When contextualising this, a taxonomic system emerged providing a generalised, unifying symmetry framework.*  Primarily showcases *a new symmetry-led design axis across all primitives*, introducing a programme to learn about and leverage the consequences of building blocks as a new form of control on our models. The consequences are argued to be significant and an underexplored facet of DL.  Predicts *how* our default choice of primitives may be quietly biasing networks, causing *a range* of unintended and interesting phenomena across various applications. New building blocks mean ***new network behaviours to unlock*** and avoid hidden harmful 'pathologies'.  This paper directly challenges any assumption that primitive functional *forms* are neutral choices. Providing *several predictions* surrounding interpretability phenomena as side effects of current primitive choices (*now empirically confirmed, see below*). Raising questions in optimisation, AI safety, and potentially adversarial robustness.  &gt;There's also a [***handy blog***](https://medium.com/@george.bird.uom/draft-a-hidden-inductive-bias-at-the-heart-of-deep-learning-4e197b56f34c) that runs through these topics in a hopefully more approachable way.  **Empirical (3rd) Paper: Quantised Representations (PPP) \[**[**link**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.12070)**\]:**  &gt;*TL;DR: By altering primitives it is shown that current ones cause representations to clump into clusters ---* *likely undesirable* *--- whilst symmetric alternatives keep them smooth.*  Probes the consequences of altering the foundational building blocks, assessing their effects on representations. Demonstrates how foundational biases emerge from various symmetry-defined choices, including new activation functions.  Confirms an IDL prediction: anisotropic primitives induce discrete representations, while isotropic primitives yield smoother representations that may support better interpolation and organisation. It disposes of the 'absolute frame' discussed in the SRM paper below.  A **new perspective on several interpretability** **phenomena**, instead of being considered fundamental to deep learning systems, this paper instead shows *our choices induce them* ***‚Äî they are not fundamentals of DL!***  'Anisotropic primitives' *are sufficient* to induce discrete linear features, grandmother neurons and potentially superposition.  * Could this eventually affect how we pick activations/normalisers in practice? *Leveraging symmetry, just as ReLU once displaced sigmoids?*  **Empirical (1st) Paper: Spotlight Resonance Method (SRM) \[**[**link**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13471)**\]:**  &gt;*TL;DR: A new tool shows primitives force activations to align with hidden axes, explaining why neurons often seem to represent specific concepts.*  This work shows there must be an ""absolute frame"" created by primitives in representation space: neurons and features align with special coordinates imposed by the primitives themselves. Rotate the basis, and the representations rotate too ‚Äî revealing that phenomena like ""grandmother neurons"" or superposition may be induced by our functional choices rather than fundamental properties of networks.  This paper motivated the initial reformulation for building blocks.  # Overall:  Hopefully, an exciting research agenda, with a tangent enquiry on symmetry from existing GDL and Parameter Symmetries approaches.  Curious to hear what others think of this research arc so far:  * What reformulations or consequences (positive or negative) interest you most? Any implications I've missed? * If symmetry in our primitives is shaping how networks think, *should we treat it as a core design axis*?  I hope this research direction may catch your interest for future collaborations on:  &gt;*Discovering more undocumented effects of our functional form choices could be a productive research direction*, alongside designing new building blocks and leveraging them for better performance."

I am working on a project to automatically generate cybersecurity detection rules from blogs and/or user requests.   My initial approach hasn‚Äôt worked very well so far. I suspect this is because the model I‚Äôm using (`Kimi-K2`) struggles with the domain, as it differs from the data it was originally trained on. I‚Äôve also experimented with `Qwen3-32B` with similar results.  There are a few key requirements:  * The system must run on-premises, due to the sensitive nature of detection rule data. * It must be able to generate detection rules from blog posts and/or user requests.  For example:      Can you write a rule for Linux that detects suspicious use of the cron utility, specifically when crontab jobs are being created or modified from files in the `/tmp` directory? I want this to focus on potential abuse for persistence or execution of malicious code, and it should be based on process creation logs. Please include ATT&amp;CK mappings for T1053.003 and note that legitimate admin activity could be a false positive.  Or:      Generate a detection rule based on this: https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/prc-nexus-espionage-targets-diplomats  # My Current Approach  1. **Content extraction** ‚Äì I use *crawl4ai* to fetch the content from URLs. 2. **Content summarization** ‚Äì Since the raw content is often noisy, I summarize it to remove unnecessary elements such as cookie banners, headers, or navigation menus, while trying to preserve as much relevant information as possible. 3. **Similarity retrieval** ‚Äì I retrieve similar detection rules from our internal database using a hybrid search approach, which works reasonably well. 4. **Draft generation** ‚Äì I make an initial LLM request to generate a first draft of the rule, using a few-shot setup that includes the retrieved similar rules as context. 5. **Reflection loop** ‚Äì I validate the generated rule‚Äôs syntax. If an error is found, the system re-enters the previous step, this time including the error message as additional context.  However, this approach performs poorly. The detection block in the generated rules often fails to capture the actual detection logic correctly, leading to rules that look valid syntactically but don‚Äôt work effectively for their intended purpose.  I also experimented with breaking down the generation process into multiple steps. For instance, first asking the model to determine the detection path or flow based on the blog content or user request. However, the results are still not very good.  Now, I am considering fine-tuning a model using LoRA with a custom dataset that includes:  * The blog post or user request as input, and * The corresponding final detection rule as output.  I‚Äôd like to get your opinion on this approach and hear about other methods or architectures that might yield better results. Thank you!"

Ended up testing TEE-secured inference and honestly the results surprised me. We're seeing around 7% overhead compared to standard deployment. That's for a BERT-based model processing about 50k documents daily.  The setup uses Intel TDX on newer Xeon chips. Attestation happens every few minutes to verify the enclave hasn't been tampered with. The cryptographic verification adds maybe 2-3ms per request which is basically nothing for our use case.  What really helped was keeping the model weights inside the enclave and only passing encrypted inputs through. Initial load time is longer but inference speed stays close to native once everything's warm.  For anyone doing similar work with sensitive data, TEE is actually viable now. The performance gap closed way faster than I expected.  Anyone else running production workloads in enclaves? Curious what performance numbers you're seeing."

You upload your data, shape it with SQL transformations as needed, and then expose it via documented, secured endpoints.  We originally built it when we needed an API from the Scottish Energy Performance Certificate dataset, which is shared as a zip of 18 CSV files totalling 7.17 GB, which you can now access freely here: https://epcdata.scot/  It currently supports CSV, JSONL (optionally gzipped), JSON (array), Parquet, XLSX &amp; ODS file formats for files of any size. The SQL transformations allow you to join across datasets, transform, aggregate and even geospatial indexing via H3.  It‚Äôs free to sign up with no credit card required and has generous free tier (1 GB or storage and 500 requests/month).

I ended up getting a part time freelance gig with a food company while I was in school, making nutrition labels for a Texas food company.   Always loved this one specific music festival/record label. Ended up getting a gig working the merch table during a fest. Within 3 years I have a title as ""Junior Art Director"". I get paid as well as I think they could reasonably pay me. I love working for them. Honestly shocked how involved I am with them. I also set up merch ops for them 2-3x a year at their events.   My main source of revenue is designing apparel, record packaging, so print design. I have designed original art for shirts that have sold very well.  At the same time, I do not make a liveable amount of money. My hourly is very good and I even get a health insurance stipend but due to irregular hours I am below the poverty line. Plus I am worried I am in such a niche genre it wouldnt translate to getting hired anywhere.  Graphic design is completely oversaturated. I have applied to other jobs and I don't even get a reply back. In the rare occasions I have gotten an interview, its with a company id have zero interest in, and they tell me my style doesnt match their style, and to be honest, most design roles get 200-300 applicants and thats insane for me to be able to stand out.  My food company gig (i get maybe 6 hours a month in a good month from then nowadays, seriously.) has a main graphic designer. He worked for a big world famous vodka company for 8 years. They laid him off and he went 1.5 years with no work at all, applyong everywhere he could.   It just seems like I have gotten myself into a corner. I just need a job that I could make 60,000 a year at and thats really all I need. I have a specific skillset (graphic design and packaging design for print production) that is only partial to all the design jobs out there. I am not good with coding or UX/UI and that sounds miserable to me.   Where do I trade my joy for a paycheck?!  Doubt anyones read this much but I love filmmaking. I collect 16mm cameras and digital cine cameras and shoot weird short films as outsider art. Theres no way I could compete for the limited amount of film prod jobs in Austin.  I am a very good worker and all, I just worry my career has hit a dead end. I do all this cool work I always wanted to do, which is fulfilling, but I almost never have more than 1000$ to my name at a time and it brings me a lot of stress."

I live a frugal life and I'm happy with it. I also plan to make money outside of the work so it's all good. * **Benefits**¬†\- Already mentioned retirement, but obviously healthcare is very important.

My mind keeps coming back to teaching. I'm really good with kids, patient enough to not care at all about them spouting meme bs like 6-7 or skibidi rizz ohio, I've worked as a tutor before and found it fulfilling, and I don't care much about the money as long as I can sustain a healthy life.

I'm an engineering student, and pretty much all top engineering unis in the country have student teams, which operate like not-for-profit companies. The biggest teams are very competitive to get into, and a lot of top companies recruit through these teams and the competitions compete in.  For context, I applied for the motorsport team, as my dream is getting to work in the motorsport industry. A lot of these companies recruit primarily through Formula Student, so getting into a student team is the best way of getting my foot in the door esp since I'm based in Aus which is very far away from where a lot of these companies mainly hire.  I've been aiming for this team for years and have been building up my skills for this particular role. I've been told by multiple faculty members and previous members of this particular team that I was more than qualified and their ideal candidate. I had also expressed interest and chatted with the managers of the position I was aiming for multiple times prior.  I applied the day applications opened, and was offered an interview a couple days later, so I know they liked my application. I obviously can't speak objectively but in my opinion the interview went very well. I had prepared loads for the pre-interview scenario they gave me, and answered all their questions and scenarios coherently and confidently. I was very confident after my interview.  A few weeks later I had a meeting with another faculty member I had reached out to because I was curious about the research he was undertaking. He noticed I was very passionate, and offered me a spot on his student team. I was hesitant because the motorsport team I had applied for requires a large workload and I wasn't sure if they'd be happy with me being on another team. He said he worked with them frequently to help their operations and assured me they'd be fine with it. I ended up joining his team and have been loving my experience so far. He also personally recommended me to the CEO of the motorsport team.  I am sure the motorsport team realised I was in a second team, but I thought they would be fine with it, as all I had to confirm was that I'd be able to commit 25h/week, not that I could only be in one team. Unless they thought that I had hid the fact I was in a team when I applied (even though I only joined later).  I got a rejection email 2 days ago and I was devastated. This team was the easiest way for me to nudge my way into the motorsport industry, and not to mention I had been aspirating towards this for years. I emailed them minutes after, politely requesting a meeting to receive feedback on my application so I can improve it for next year. I just genuinely don't think me having a lack of skill is the issue, but if they rejected me because I was in a second team then even if I reapply next year they'd just reject me again.  I've also been seriously questioning my own skills and abilities after this. I've been feeling like absolute shit and have no idea what to do. I know I won't give up on getting in, but I'm still devastated and unmotivated.  I'd appreciate any tips on how to take rejection better. I know it's going to get a lot more frequent when I graduate.  TLDR: I was rejected from a position after spending multiple years developing skills for this particular role and doing well in the interview. I'm gutted, questioning my abilities and lost."

I spent two years finishing 10th and 11th grade through the ALS Accelerating program.  Now I'm 18 and currently in 12th grade, I decided to go to an actual highschool to meet teenagers my age, and experience highschool as I've been yearning for them since I wasted my first three years of teenagehood trying to mature up and be serious about religion.  I was thrilled with my new encounters and activities in school, like meeting new people, exploring hobbies they introduce to me, dancing, eating at the canteen, walking home with friends, and simple daily highschool stuff which mean a lot to me bec I was never able to experience them before. But lately, I started feeling so drained and tired of the routine, projects here and there, listening and sitting all day, teachers treating us like we're in a workplace. I wanna leave inspite having two great bestfriends there, honestly they're the only reasons why I still somehow wanna stay.  I just realized lately that I won't be shining there, academics really isn't my thing anymore. I crave for new experiences like hobbies and skills(hiking, knitting, cooking, joining workshops and events, learing a martial art), and those stuff are not what I'll be able to find in an educational field (i.e highschool). I planned on switching to ALS Acceleration Program again where I would only attend school once a week, and I'll have 6 days for work to fund my dream experiences and explore more stuff that I could've explored during 6 hours of sitting in school everyday.  But the consequeces I'll face is, I might miss some highschool experiences or memories that might be waiting for me.  Note: I'm still under my parent's roof so  wont have to worry about moving out yet til I graduate 12th grade, and I won't be staying in that job either, I wish to build financial freedom so I won't have to be an employee for the rest of my life.

I would have stayed the extra 2 days if I had known, I make way less then I should as a media manager for a very small company (like less then 10 employees on the office side)  im not sure what im going to do if he doesnt pay me for the week he had approved and is now saying I dont have but it was already taken. Any advice pls.  TLDR: boss said I dont habe vacation time AFTER It was approved and I already took it and came back. Is this legal or any advice?"

I'm a 24f psych undergrad student about to graduate.   When I picked my major, it was my 2nd time changing it (bio--&gt; graphic design --&gt; psych). I went through a bout of emotional/mental crises during college that severely affected my performance as a student. I didn't have the college experience I expected and as a whole its been mostly negative.   I have loved psych and my main interest was either neuropsych or forensics.  My plan was to continue with the phd. But... where i live, Puerto Rico(a US territory) there is NO such thing as fully funded phds. Most admissions committees would find that laughable; here its normal &amp; expected to go into debt for your phd.   I really don't think it would be responsible of me to rack up another $30k in debt when I already have about $8k in student loans. I have thought about getting a master's, seeing as the masters in psych allows you to work as a psychologist in PR (laws are different in that regard here). But the masters here aren't accredited by any US board.  Either way, the salary for these degrees seems like it would not be a good return on investment (I understand the median salary for psychologists here is 40k). I am in a position where I need to consider that extensively; I don't have the luxury of a safety net nor am I comfortable having loans until I reach 50 like so many people here seem to be.  I've considered other careers like medicine or allied health careers. I was originally a bio major with the intention of being pre-dentistry but I dropped out because I struggled with chemistry. I don't know how many people drop out of bio and then successfully re-transition into those fields. What's more I feel like I lack the purpose or passion to pursue anything as grandiose as medicine because I don't really believe I'm intellectually capable.  It feels too late for me, I feel hopeless and like my path is set and there's little I can do about it."

I was going to stick it out for a year, but i got a job offer in April for a job I had applied for months previously, as an Assistant director of a non-profit, and it shortened my commute from one hour to five minutes and my pay increased by 25%. So, i took it.  At this job, i like my coworkers, my job tasks are relatively easy, and my hours are flexible. However, my manager is unstable, the organization‚Äôs future is unclear, and i have limited growth opportunities. My boss lies and constantly makes excuses, claiming he works 50-60 hour weeks when we barely see him in the office for 40. Not to mention, one time in a fit of rage he damaged an office wall by punching a hole through it upon finding out i had gone home early for the day. As an organization, we only have money for payroll through the end of the year and once that comes and goes, our future payroll will depend on grants or donations. Further, my only place for advancement is my managers position, which i have a solid chance of getting one day, but due to our financial situation i wonder if that day will come.  I miss my tasks as a legal assistant and want to go back to it, but with 2 months working there on my resume and 6 months working here, i wonder if i should just stick it out or my r√©sum√©‚Äôs sake until we go under or to jump ship now.

Recently about 5 months ago I started with a big company (coming from a construction field) and into a corporate role. The transition into office culture was okay but obviously different. I was a bit rough around the edges but I am experienced in what I was employed for but a bit rough on the office culture stuff you know. Anyway long story short there were really nice people, but I feel I had a target on my back from my first week, maybe because of my background, or I‚Äôm somewhat out of my comfort zone. Here‚Äôs a quick recap of why:  - my work computer was reassigned to a more senior staff by my  manager in my first week (because they didn‚Äôt have one yet) This had all my personal information like salary, next of kin, along will my work emails and logins. The company is very big on privacy etc.  - KPIs were never explained or implemented or even discussed by management.  - job description not clearly defined, and management couldn‚Äôt encompass what‚Äôs required. - Management we‚Äôre quite young and treated staff like Childeren, over the top praise eg you guys have done absolutely amazing today, but then next day say how disappointed they were and threatened firing someone (on their phone)  -other staff using my work login as theirs was not working, this had all my personal details on there.  - Very minimal training despite me telling management I need more constantly. They organised training but lasted literally 5 mins then it was cancelled. - work hours was explained to be flexible then changed to a rigid hours. - had to work over Christmas period, never discussed before. - little guidance and support but management, would Tell their superiors that they are made mistakes, and deflected responsibility. - my direct manager became passive aggressive as I swapped a working from home with working from office. The job is totally computer based. The manager told me to come in the office when everyone if working at home as punishment.  - excluded from some team meetings without explanation. Managers giving me instructions via email to another employee, when they are sitting beside me. - managers in their own echo chambers and very power hungry. - higher above managers not even saying hi in the elevator or walk past with acknowledgment. - a lot of my questions (work related ignored in the chat and glanced over)  -witnessed manager making fun on a co worker on cctv who injured themselves at work and is on leave.   What did it for me was my direct manager telling me to come into work, when I was working from home. I explained that I had family responsibility and to switch days (only required 2 days p/w in office) they doubled down and told me to come into the office. It was a power struggle for them, and it highlighted I didn‚Äôt want to work here anymore.   Unfortunately Im done with this culture and it‚Äôs disappointing as it‚Äôs a big career move for me. Has anyone ever experienced this sort of thing? Has not helped with my daily enjoyment and made me feel quite down to be honest. Has anyone else experienced this? I can get work easily. I almost want to make a complaint to HR but know it would be a waste of time."

These responsibilities have come with a small increase in pay but not enough to justify the amount of work and I often end up doing unpaid labor because no one else is able to step up and handle it (or no one else is willing). My bosses are kind but largely chaotic and disorganized and I am left cleaning up their messes. I KNOW I need to leave this job, but every time I even consider looking somewhere else I am overcome with the guilt and shame that they will go under without me (they have said as much multiple times; when I had to take a couple months off to recover from a surgery my bosses freaked out over the stress) I understand this type of guilt and shame is one of the ways some non-profits keep their employees, but I cannot get past it and because the job market is as bad as it is I've convinced myself that I can't find anything better.

careerguidance,1ojjkjj,Is the tech industry for me? Should I even bother trying to get an entry-level CS job anymore?,kyxst,4,3,1761779077.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1ojjkjj/is_the_tech_industry_for_me_should_i_even_bother/,"22M, just recently graduated from university with a degree in computer science.  I think I applied to university mostly because I felt like I had to. I was a smart kid that felt like I needed to attend university so I wouldn‚Äôt let myself or my family down by wasting my potential. I also wasn‚Äôt mentally ready to leave school and abandon the routine/structure that school provided. I originally majored in math because it was my best subject in high school and I genuinely enjoyed solving math problems, but then I started to get worried about what careers I could pursue with a math degree. Everyone was telling me it wasn‚Äôt the best decision to major in math, so since math and computer science are kinda related in a way and people have always said that tech is a good industry to pursue, I switched to computer science.  I always considered myself to be a good CS student. I‚Äôve gotten A‚Äôs in almost every CS class I‚Äôve taken, I never cheated on my assignments or tests, and I really enjoyed learning a lot of the concepts I learned in university. That being said, I never really did anything related to CS outside of my coursework. I spent all my time in school focusing on my coursework, and then any free time I got went towards TV, video games, or doomscrolling. I never did any internships, side projects, or volunteer work in my 5 years of university. I‚Äôve lived with my parents my whole life and I don‚Äôt have a single bit of job experience (not even from a minimum wage job).  Now that I‚Äôm out of school and looking for jobs, I‚Äôm really questioning what the hell I‚Äôve been doing for the past 5 years. I‚Äôve been applying to jobs for a few months now, but I haven‚Äôt gotten a single interview. I have nothing to put on my resume other than my degree (as well as some programming languages I know), and I don‚Äôt have the motivation or passion to do side projects. As for volunteering and internships, I‚Äôm unsure if I wanna do that or not. A few people have also suggested to me the idea of pursuing a master‚Äôs degree, but that just feels like it would be a sunk cost. I have to start paying back my student loans soon, and I don‚Äôt know if I can afford to go back to school again (at least right now).  I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm built for this job market. I see posts on Reddit all the time about people in CS who have years of experience and tons of side projects, yet they can‚Äôt get jobs. That along with the rise of AI and everyone getting laid off makes me feel incredibly insecure because I feel like I could never stick out in this industry. If people with tons of CS experience can‚Äôt get CS related jobs, what are the odds that I could ever get one?  I really regret not taking a gap year between high school and university to consider what I wanted to do with my career. I also regret never stopping once to actually decide if CS is what I wanted to pursue (university was hard, so I just kept telling myself ‚Äúdo the work now, worry about career stuff later‚Äù). I have enjoyed doing CS while I was in school (for example, I really enjoyed making apps and websites for course projects), but I don‚Äôt think I necessarily have a passion for CS. In fact, I don‚Äôt even know if I have a passion in any field as of right now.  This post might be a giant mess, but I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. Should I keep trying to apply for entry-level CS jobs and pray that one of these recruiters somehow chooses me for an interview? Should I just work a minimum wage job? I owe so much money in student loans right now, and I don‚Äôt want my computer science degree to go to waste, but I just don‚Äôt feel confident that I could get a computer science related job. I also feel like I‚Äôm scared to let people down."

I‚Äôm just not sure what‚Äôs the better move. If you had to choose again, which path would you take? Do you start with a digital marketing specialist role to get a broader foundation, or go straight for an SEO-focused position (like an SEO specialist role) so you can build your skills in that area from the start?

So now I have this options I have been weighing on.     A) Managerial role in a big 4 firm (my previous work place)  They reached out with a salary of 140k for audit manager for the second time (this is confirmed i made sure). I find it weird coz I think the audit manager position is roughly around 80 - 90k that is why i did not push though when they first reached out because i don't wanna go back again knowing the burnout i felt the first time.  The pros for this are  1)  my old self 5 years ago would have jumped and take this in an instant. Weirdly, now I just don't wanna go back to the same cage.   2) Managerial position, which gives me a better chance to work abroad (this was my plan before, now i don't want it anymore -- actually i don't see myself working in the industry 5 years from now, although i am not sure which path to take yet)  3) Have socialization (don't have with pure wfh)  4) Higher salary (150k)    Cons:  1) Hybrid (I prefer wfh set up)  2) Burn out toll for sure  3) it is my old company, it feels weird to go back    B) US firm Audit Senior role (wfh)  The second is a senior audit role for 110k-120k for US base clients.  Pros:  1) I have more time for myself and my hobbies/travel goals since it is night shift.  2) Maybe have a slower pace (base on the interview, I asked their work culture)    Cons  1) It may take a toll on physical health in the long run since it is night shift   2) Progression seems uncertain ( i may be a manager based on the interview - i can lead staffs as the firm is growing, but 5 years from now, i don‚Äôt see myself working in the industry)  3) Slightly lower than my previous salary in SG job which is 130-140k.    Logically, it would seem the managerial position fits the bill is it? Also, this is a safe choice if i plan to work abroad in the future. But weirdly, I wanted to take the US clients senior role and really work on my hobbies other goals for a planned exit.    For context, I took a break and I can feel the burn out for real. and it had me question everything... It is scary how i lost my will to strive in corporate life..    As I am planning exit in the industry, I want comments from the people who worked long in the industry, if is it worth it?? I have planned career map before and really had the grit to pursue it and i did and I know I can, but is it worth it?  Really... If so, how did you manage burn out? How did you find purpose in all this?    For those who exit, how is life.. please tell me it is better... and there is more to life than this career. Because now, if i take the managerial role in my previous job, it seems i am back to grinding and got no time for myself. If i take the US clients senior role, i have more time for myself as I have hobbies i want to improve on but career path is more uncertain (which doesn't matter as now I want to exit in the future, but can I really exit and have financial freedom)    Am I just burn out now and needed some new perspective in corpo life?? I was burn out before over the years. I had breaktimes as well, but I did not lost my grit but now I do and it is scaryy how did I come to this point where corpo life is meaningless??    I know the managerial role opportunity in my previous firm is a safe option and a pathway to moving abroad plan i have before which part of me wants...  But why does it not make sense to me..  The US firm senior role is have uncertain path forward but i have time for myself to work on hobbies and transition/exit out which is really really not what i planned before.. but somehow it's where i am leaning to. And now I am at a crossroad..."

I regret doing it, I wasted so much time and money pursuing something that I don't even want to do, and when I realized I didn't want to pursue InfoSec it was already too late because I only had one semester left, which makes me so upset; however, I have been looking into Environmental work (Env.

Looking back, I really wish I had been able to go the geography/environmental route when picking my major, but I always saw it as a hobby rather than my career, and I feel like I'm screwed because A) I don't really have any experience in those fields B) I have no money to go back to school C) Job Market sucks currently.

(Business Banking/Commercial RM Role),Appropriate_Fill_782,1,0,1761791632.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1ojo7jc/highrisk_banking_offer_preemptive_disclosure/,"Seeking advice from HR, Compliance, or experienced hiring managers, particularly those in regulated industries like finance/banking. I am at a critical juncture and need feedback on a high-risk strategy.¬†  Background:¬†  ‚Ä¢ Role: Commercial Relationship Manager (Mid-Market).¬†  ‚Ä¢ Industry: Regulated Regional Commercial Bank (Bank A).¬†  ‚Ä¢ Compensation: Verbally agreed-upon Target Total Cash Comp (TCC) of $175K.¬†  ‚Ä¢ Status: I am the top candidate. The Hiring Manager (HM) and executive boss have given strong signals, and the written offer is imminent this week. When the HM spoke to my former colleague that referred me after my second round interview, he told her ""I was polished and crushed it"".¬†  The Problem (The Risk): I anticipate a contingent offer that will require a background/credit check (standard for the industry). My compliance risk factors are severe:¬†  1 Credit Score: Currently in the mid-400s (due to mass layoff and failed startup launch). Several accounts are in default.¬†  2 Income Verification: I have a significant gap in W2/1099 income as I was involved in a start-up (post-layoff). The owner of the business was a former client and ask me to help him build the business out/scale it. There was a back and forth about bringing me on via W2 or 1099, and when the latter was offered, I made the mistake of thinking I'll sort that out later. There is a paper trail of payments via Zelle, personal check, Apple Pay, and possibly PayPal. He always offered and will be willing to do a verbal verification of employment (IE the background check company reaches him directly once it doesn't show a record as for W2 or 1099). I should've been more assertive here, but the plan for bringing me on in a formal manner was never properly executed. The original plan was for him to quit his W2 job and solely focus on the business ($1.5M in revenue in AV/IT) as of January 2025, but that timeline kept getting pushed back. He waffled with that and with some of the strategic initiatives I was rolling out. He will (per my last convo with him), probably quit current job in January 2026. I decided to stick out the startup because it gave me the opportunity to work on cool stuff like building out sales processes and strategy (I came up with the idea of rolling out AVaaS, which we are about to roll out). It also gave me the flexibility to work out some personal matters, as I valued healing instead of taking a job at a competitor I could've gotten in April/May 2024 at pay rate higher than the job that laid me off (and most of your division). I don't regret working the startup, what I learned was invaluable (I even self taught myself more about the industry and even landed a distributor/supplier for us organically on my own). This entrepreneurial approach to business is something I spoke on during the interview process and made me more attractive. My previous job was a similar role for a major national bank, and I passed background check with a score in the high 500s and low 600s.¬†  My Strategic Dilemma: I fear my offer will be pulled automatically if Compliance discovers the 400s score cold. I have executive support (the HM wants me).¬†  My Proposed Mitigation Strategy (Need Feedback): My plan is to NOT sign the contingent offer immediately, but instead:¬†  1 Secure the written offer and accept it contingent on the check.¬†  2 IMMEDIATELY call the Recruiter/HR (before the check is initiated).¬†  3 Execute Pre-Emptive Disclosure: Explain the situation using an accountable narrative, tying the defaults and income gap directly to the mass layoff and the launch-phase instability of my venture.¬†  4 Present a Plan of Action (POA): Commit to a formal, immediate repayment schedule/consolidation using the new salary, and offer to provide monthly status updates to HR/Compliance.¬†  The Question for Experienced Professionals:¬†  1 Is this Pre-Emptive Disclosure strategy viable? Is bringing the HR rep into the loop before the check the only way to seek a Compliance exception? Is it best to wait until it comes up? Should I wait until after the offer is accepted but before the background check and explain to the background company. I've heard a mixed bag. I was thinking about waiting until it comes up as my layoff was 18 months ago, the beginning of a mass wave of layoffs across industries where this scenario is becoming more commonplace.¬†  2 In your experience, what is the likelihood of a Compliance waiver/exception being granted for a high-value candidate (with executive sponsorship) when the default/debt is tied to a documented professional/economic dislocation, provided a clear POA is established?¬†  Any non-judgmental, practical feedback from professionals in HR or regulated industries would be invaluable. Thank you."

Am I the bad person for moving on from my manager who I've been with for 7 years with blind loyalty.  I've been with the company I'm with now for 9 years. I joined while I was still in college as a part-timer and have grown with them as a graduate full-time employee. The first 2 years were various warehouse or data entry jobs but for the last 7 years I have been in sales. 4 years were in outside sales where I was building relationships up with minimal foundations and the past 3 years have been with one client in more of an account management role. I have build such a great relationship with the client that I don't really even have to sell to them anymore, they come to me for advice/solutions, no longer me hunting for it. Honestly, most sellers dream.  Currently with the position/relationship I have found myself in with this client, I feel I've become complacent to the sales cycle because of how easy it has become which is causing me to miss out on professional growth. Friends and prior sales coworkers who have moved to different departments within the company have climbed the ladder and are making big career impacts, all while I'm still in the same sales department I was in 7 years ago. Undoubtedly, I have grown vastly in my personal and business intelligence being in the various sales roles, it just feels like I'm being complacent.  Over the past month or so I have been doing a lot of self reflection and thinking about what is next in my career. I've been with the same company and been in sales for the entire time I've been out of college. I always thought my next step for my career would be into sales leadership. 4 years ago I started planting that leadership seed when I reached out to my manager to find out what is looked for in a potential sales leader. Upon getting this list of things, I made a game plan to achieve those, of which I crushed all of them. Ultimately, a large team leader role came up a year after this conversation and I was passed up because I got out resumed by the other candidate. I could not hate because he was the better candidate for what the market needed at the time. I worked along side this employee as we were the same level and reported to the same manager he just had a team while I did not.  Fast forward to 3 weeks ago, the manager that was involved in all of this initial career growth conversations was more locations to add onto his territory. He now no longer has time to spend time with everyone on the team so he has created an assistant manager role and promoted up the person that out resumed me the first time. I now will be reporting to him. I feel bad as he is a great person but I can't get over the mental hurdle of the fact that he beat me, I then worked along side of him and now have to report to him. This is all while further delaying my potential leadership promotion. When I brought this up with the main manager who made all these moves he said that I ""just needed to be patient"", that I'm ""too much in my head"" ""overthinking hypotheticals and that ""the company is always growing and changing, I can move to a different part of the territory and start there""  Circling back to the self reflection, I thought that maybe sales leadership is not what I would be interested in. It's hard to motivate others to sell and hit goals when I can't seem to motivate myself to get that next promotion. I seem to only keep getting further and further away from the promotion. This got me thinking that if I'm not getting into sales leadership, and that I have a fear of becoming complacent in my sale, then what am I actually doing.  The cherry on top to this is one of my old coworkers at the company before I went to sales reached out to me earlier this week and asked me for the 3rd time in 18months to come join his team. This job would be in the supply chain/operations side of the business. When asked during the interview process about pay. I would have a salary more than what I get in my sales role with commission. I feel bad considering it because the main manager I have is a great guy and him and I started as equals 8 years ago and I feel loyal to him. Now I'm in a rock and a hard place on whether or not I stay or goal.  Some misc. thoughts I have:   \- Even though this manager has passed me up for promotion I feel this blind loyalty to him and taking this new position if I accept it, would be disloyal of me   \- I'm semi-fearful that staying in sales for much longer will hinder me because I will be stuck as just a sales person   \- How do I get over this FOMO of my client. I love what I do right now but like I said, I feel stagnate.   \- Am I stupid for considering leaving a gravy sales position?  Sorry for the long post, I'm losing sleep over it and needed to vent!"

I work in construction sales and the earning potential is insane. Minimum you are making is at least 120k per year, if not more. I feel like I‚Äôm compensated well and I don‚Äôt have to deal with any financial stress.   With that being said, I hate sales. I was undecided with what I wanted to pursue in college fresh out of high school, so I went for one semester and then I dropped out. I had a connection in wireless sales and started working there. Ended up sticking around for 5 years, started as a consultant, worked my way up to GM. I was told going into management would be different and I should give it a shot, so I did. I still hated it. I quit. I was living at home at the time so it wasn‚Äôt a huge deal. At this point in time I wanted to go back to school for nursing, so I went to take my prereqs at my local community college and took an easy side job so I could still pay for my own personal expenses while still living at home.   Long story short, life threw a huge curveball at me. My dad was starting to have issues with alcohol and he started becoming really aggressive. The final straw was when I came back from a family trip &amp; he was super upset with me and tried putting hands on me. He kicked me out of the house when this happened. Unfortunately, I went straight into survival mode, had to figure out how to provide for myself financially, and since I knew I had the skill to sell, I went back into sales. It was the only way I knew I could make money that I needed quickly. One of my cousins who lived across the country from me at the time opened up her home to me and let me stay with her for 6 months so I could get up on my feet, which luckily I did. She also introduced me to the role I am in now and that truly did help turn my finances around quickly. I live on my own and I don‚Äôt have to depend on anyone but myself.  This job is great with providing financial stability, but it comes with a LOT of sacrifice. I‚Äôm working 12+ hours 5 days a week, sometimes 6. I wake up at 6-7 in the morning and I‚Äôm not home till 10pm some nights. I‚Äôm driving almost 5 hours a day every single day from one side of the state to the other to meet clients. I make good money, but no time to enjoy it. I also feel really lonely because I don‚Äôt have many friends out here and dating is hard with no time. I feel my physical and mental health declining because I don‚Äôt have enough energy to make friends or meet new people. My days off I‚Äôm sleeping because I‚Äôm so drained. I‚Äôve noticed a lot of health issues slowly start to pop up as well. Probably correlated to all the stress I‚Äôve gone through this past year.   I feel stuck. I feel like I was robbed of what I actually wanted to pursue which was the medical field. There‚Äôs absolutely no way this job would allow me to  have time to take classes part time. It eats all my time. I barely even have time for myself. I also can‚Äôt afford not to work at this point and just go to school because I have bills to pay.   I don‚Äôt know if anyone has ever been faced with a similar situation and has made it out on the other side. Any advice would be appreciated."

careerguidance,1ojdey3,My GM is encouraging me to apply for a leadership role in a dept I have no experience in. Advice?,Chemical_Pen_7403,3,2,1761764604.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1ojdey3/my_gm_is_encouraging_me_to_apply_for_a_leadership/,"Hi all,   CONTEXT:  I (29f) have been a housekeeper/inspector for 4 years at my current job. I was promoted to HSKP Supervisor back in March. Although it was the exact job I have already been doing the past 3 years, we were finally able to convince corporate to have the ‚Äúsupervisor‚Äù position created in order to actually compensate me fairly. I was doing MUCH more than my other hskp coworkers. (Side note: As a supervisor, I did not have any real authority. My direct manager handled all of that.)   Fast forward to a few days ago, my GM approached me about a job opening within our company. Our Front Desk Manager has found a new employer and that position will need to be filled soon. I have absolutely zero experience with front desk. I do have experience with the guests and other transferable skills. However, I have never had a desk job, never been in charge of other team members, been responsible for schedules, conflicts, etc.   I am capable and adaptable. I do believe I can learn everything if I am given the appropriate tools, resources, and comprehensive training.  This would be a great opportunity for me. I have been wanting to get into some management role for a long time in order to start establishing a career. Our property is very small, so there‚Äôs not a lot of room to grow. My GM and HSKP mgr are in full support. They believe in me.   I am just concerned that with no experience, this is a very big undertaking. I don‚Äôt want to be set up for failure. My biggest struggle is that I am usually extremely non-confrontational. I know that is not really an option if you want to be an effective leader.   There‚Äôs also the fact that I know everyone at my workplace. Some of them are my friends. Transitioning into one of their managers seems very awkward. Luckily, our FD team is fairly new, so I don‚Äôt have established relationships with them the way I do with the housekeepers.   This would be a huge stepping stone for me and my future. I just don‚Äôt want to get this job, end up miserable, crash and burn. Also my schedule would change and I‚Äôd have to work some nights, be available pretty much all the time, etc. (ugh lol)    TL;DR: GM approached me about moving up within the company to a completely new department. I have zero experience, but my managers believe in me. Need advice about taking on a leadership role for the first time.   QUESTIONS: So, anyone that has taken on a leadership role without previous experience, please offer up any advice. What were your biggest struggles going into the role? What helped you grow? Did you ever have regrets? How do you deal with conflict, whether its customers/guests or your own team members? Were you younger than the employees you were managing? If so, how did you navigate that?  Or any other general advice. Thank you!"

During my stint with the Navy, I was a Seabee and got to see the world a little. One kid born in California, one in Hawaii and one in Okinawa, Japan and they were the main reason I didn't want to make a career out of the Navy; or be a ""lifer"" as they would say. In hindsight, i made the right choice and I have some great kids. . .I'd like to think due in part to dad (me lol) being there for them for everything. My wife and I were very close and did everything together and we have both been very involved in every aspect of life; including working together at the post office.     Neither of us ever thought we could ever get tired of each other no matter how much time we spent together. Sure, we could get on each others nerves here and there but making up is fun! Plus if ya'll don't ever have a disagreement then it is probably because ya'll don't communicate, but what we didn't consider was how people change, people aren't always honest, family members can be manipulative, couples tend to blame shift, kids are selfish, humans in general suck, we both suck with money, the lottery is elusive, etc.   I have been to a couple interviews but for the most part no one will interview me. Putting myself in the hiring person's position, I wouldn't interview me either cuz if I did background checks and had the choice between someone with 2 dwi in 2 years and someone without dwi's, I'm choosing the not problem child all day every day. For the record I haven't had a drink, or a dwi since 2021. I've been out of work since June.   I am very proficient at typing, but clerical I am not. I am great with tools and have an extensive knowledge of construction and maintenance along with safety and I'm good for lifting heavy things and like to get dirty. I don't have a ton of experience working on cars but I can do what I consider to be the basics: brakes, rotors, starter, alternator, bleeding brakes, calipers, etc.   I've considered becoming a handyman but idk if its nerves or what, or the fact I do not have an A type personality, but people tend to not trust me, or at least it feels that way. Too much eye contact? At this point with the wife and I not speaking much, idk what the future holds there but she is still at the post office and she is working another job and I want to make some income but out of the 100+ jobs I've applied for I was interviewed for Starbucks and they passed on me and a job with TDLR I missed the phone interview that morning cuz my dumbass overslept.

The issue is the following:  1. Theoretically, if I had even 80% clarity in requirements, I could probably finish a dataset in a span of 1-3 days. However, this is never the case - the requirements are frequently 50% clear, I have to figure that out along developing the dataset. When there‚Äôs an issue upstream of me, I have to go back to the source files and dig deep why something is missing. I have to wait on another engineer frequently in the process to either QA why something is missing or merge my pull requests which has frequent delays.   2. In between all of this work, I frequently get asked to make enhancements or fix bugs from previous work that can easily eat 1-3 days. Some of these bugs are random and occur because the source data upstream of me randomly changed that broke my entire process. Enhancements sound simple in theory until I actually work on it.   3. There‚Äôs no standard QA process. I told my boss I wanted to develop scripts to do QA as frequently in the past if we had data issues, I would be notified by either my boss or a stakeholder because they happened to notice the issue. I figured if I run a daily script where I can get an automated email that shows all my datasets and what‚Äôs going on, it can be easier to be proactive rather than reactive. My boss said that this is something another team is working on developing but there‚Äôs no sign that there is such a thing being developed and developing a QA process for every individual project is entirely on me to figure out   4. There‚Äôs NO documentation. My team is trying to get better at this but all my projects have been a product of zero past documentation. In order to get better at this, I‚Äôm expected to create documentation on top of all this work. Documentation can easily take me 1-2 days for each project and sometimes it gets pushed to the side because of focusing on 1-3.  Even documenting on Jira easily takes me 30 mins - 1 hour   5. Add 3 hours of meeting a day on this already full plate    Instead of 3 projects in 2 weeks, I feel if my focus was on just one project - from development, QA, documentation, it would be way more manageable. But there isn‚Äôt really an option on my team as they‚Äôre obsessed with scaling up, I‚Äôm frequently told everything is a priority. My eating and sleeping schedule had gotten so messed up in the span of the past few months - I don‚Äôt have time to make breakfast, lunch or dinner and end up skipping meals a lot. I wish to get a new job and would have easily started applying now if the economy wasn‚Äôt so bad.   I‚Äôm wondering if others have experienced similar."

DS means a lot of things, and big companies are looking for specialists not generalists. There's someone to do ops, someone to do cloud engineering, someone to do dashboards, etc.  step 7: Apply as much as you can, reach out and get referral from someone. Don't talk yourself out of applying  step 8: Study at a bare minimum 20-50 hours for each hour of interview. Make sure you study for topics relevant to the role (ex. if it's in product analytics you won't have to know much ML ops)  step 9: Interview well. You have to be perfect when it comes to the fundamentals. With an 8/10 performance you will either be rejected or request follow up interviews, anything below that doesn't cut it. Your english and fundamental technical skills must be perfect. Any signs of incompetence when it comes to the basics will be red flags. You must know 'why' not just the 'what'."

With it you can build agentic systems in under 10 minutes. You can do it all through our UI, or use our python library.  What is it? Well ‚Äúagentic‚Äù is just about the most overloaded term in AI, but Kiln supports everything you need to build agents:  * [Tool Use](https://docs.kiln.tech/docs/agents#tool-use) * [Multi-Actor Interaction (aka subtasks)](https://docs.kiln.tech/docs/agents#multi-actor-interaction-aka-subtasks) * [Goal Directed, Autonomous Looping &amp; Reasoning](https://docs.kiln.tech/docs/agents#goal-directed-autonomy-and-reasoning) * [State &amp; Memory](https://docs.kiln.tech/docs/agents#state-and-memory)  **Context Management with Subtasks (aka Multi-Actor Pattern)**  Context management is the process of curating the model's context (chat/tool history) to ensure it has the right data, at the right time, in the right level of detail to get the job done.  With Kiln you can implement context management by dividing your agent tasks into subtasks, making context management easy. Each subtask can focus within its own context, then compress/summarize for the parent task. This can make the system faster, cheaper and higher quality. See our [docs on context management](https://docs.kiln.tech/docs/agents#context-management) for more details.  **Eval &amp; Optimize Agent Performance**  Kiln agents work with [Kiln evals](https://docs.kiln.tech/docs/evaluations) so you can measure and improve agent performance:  * Find the ideal model to use, balancing quality, cost and speed * Test different prompts * Evaluate end-to-end quality, or focus on the quality of subtasks * Compare different agent system designs: more/fewer subtasks  **Links and Docs**  Some links to the repo and guides:  * [Kiln AI on Github - 4k stars](https://github.com/Kiln-AI/Kiln) * [Docs for Kiln Agents](https://docs.kiln.tech/docs/agents) * [Kiln Discord](https://getkiln.ai/discord) * [Homepage](https://kiln.tech/)  Feedback and suggestions are very welcome!

Context: I‚Äôve been in the data science industry for the past 11 years. I started my career in telecom, where I worked extensively on time series analysis and data cleaning using R, Java, and Pig.  After about two years, I landed my first ‚Äúdata scientist‚Äù role in a bank, and I‚Äôve been in the financial sector ever since. Over time, I picked up Python, Spark, and TensorFlow to build ML models for marketing analytics and recommendation systems. It was a really fun period ‚Äî the industry wasn‚Äôt as mature back then. I used to get ridiculously excited whenever new boosting algorithms came out (think XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM) and spent hours experimenting with ensemble techniques to squeeze out higher uplift.  I also did quite a bit of statistical A/B testing ‚Äî not just basic t-tests, but full experiment design with power analysis, control-treatment stratification, and post-hoc validation to account for selection bias and seasonality effects. I enjoyed quantifying incremental lift properly, whether through classical hypothesis testing or uplift modeling frameworks, and working with business teams to translate those metrics into campaign ROI or customer conversion outcomes.  Fast forward to today ‚Äî I‚Äôve been at my current company for about two years. Every department now wants to apply Gen AI (and even ‚Äúagentic AI‚Äù) even though we haven‚Äôt truly tested or measured many real-world efficiency gains yet. I spend most of my time in meetings listening to people talk all day about AI. Then I head back to my table to do prompt engineering, data cleaning, testing, and evaluation. Honestly, it feels off-putting that even my business stakeholders can now write decent prompts. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm contributing much anymore. Sure, the surrounding processes are important ‚Äî but they‚Äôve become mundane, repetitive busywork.  I‚Äôm feeling understimulated intellectually and overstimulated by meetings, requests, and routine tasks. Anyone else in the same boat? Does this feel like the end of a data science journey? Am I far too gone? It‚Äôs been 11 years for me, and lately, I‚Äôve been seriously considering moving into education ‚Äî somewhere I might actually feel like I‚Äôm contributing again."

I know basic understanding of SCM but never used it, i know you get to optimize control units for a single treatment unit, but how do you perform the test when you have multiple treatments units? Do you build synthetic for each units?  If yes, do you use all control units for each treatment units? Then that means hace to do same steps multiple times?   2. How do you use anchor markets? Like do you give them more weights from initial or do we need to do something about their data before doing the performance?   3. How do you do placebo tests? Do we take a control unit then find synthetic control units? And in this synthetic do we include treatment units as well (I assume no, but still wanted to confirm)   4. Lets say we want to check incremental for x metrics, do we do the whole process x times differently for each metric? Or once we have done it for one metric we can use the same synthetics for other metrics?  (Lets say basic metrics like revenue, conversion, ctr)   5.

Yes, standard ""there are some amazing use cases, like the breast cancer imaging diagnostics"" applies, and I think it's good for those like senior leaders where ""close enough"" is all they need. Yet, on the front line in a regulated industry where ""close enough"" doesn't cut it,  what I see on a daily basis are models that:  (a) can't be trained on our data for legal and regulatory reasons and so have little to no context with which to help me in my role. Even if they could be trained on our company's data, most of the documentation - if it even exists to begin with - is wrong and out of date.  (b) are suddenly getting worse (looking at you, Claude) at coding help, largely failing at context memory in things as basic as a SQL script - it will make up the names to tables and fields that have clearly, explicitly been written out just a few lines before. Yes they can help create frameworks that I can then patch up, but I do notice degradation in performance.  (c) always manage to get \*something\* wrong, making my job part LLM babysitter. For example, my boss will use Teams transcribe for our 1:1s and sends me the AI recap after. I have to sift through because it always creates action items that were never discussed, or quotes me saying things that were never said in the meeting by anyone. One time, it just used a completely different name for me throughout the recap.  Having seen how the proverbial sausage is made, I have no desire to use it in my personal life, because why would I use it for anything with any actual stakes?

Hi everyone,  When I was looking to buy a house, a big annoyance I had was that I couldn‚Äôt easily tell if I was getting value for money. Although, in my opinion, any property is expensive as fuck, I knew that definitely some are more expensive than they should be, always within context.  At the time, what I did was manually extract historical data for the street and for the property I was interested in, in an attempt to understand whether it was going for more than the street average or less, and why. It wasn‚Äôt my best analysis, but it did the job.  Fast forward a few years later, I found myself unemployed and started building projects for my portfolio, which brings us to this post. I‚Äôve built an app that, for a given postcode, gives you historical prices, price per m¬≤, and year-on-year sales for the neighbourhood, the area, and the local authority the property falls under, as well as a property price estimation summary.  There are, of course, some caveats. Since I‚Äôm only using publicly available data, the historical trends are always going to be 2‚Äì3 months behind. However, there‚Äôs still the capacity to see overall trends e.g. an area might be up and coming if the trendline is converging toward the local authority‚Äôs average.  As for the property valuation bits, although I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs as good as what‚Äôs available out there, I‚Äôve found that at the end of the day, property prices are pretty much defined by the price of the most recent, closest property sold.  Finally, this is a portfolio project, not a product  but since I‚Äôm planning to maintain it, I thought I might as well share it with people, get some feedback, and maybe even make it a useful tool for some.     As for what's going on under the hood. The system is organized into three modules: WH, ML, and App. Each month, the WH (Warehouse) module ingests data into BigQuery, where it‚Äôs transformed following a medallion architecture. The ML module is then retrained on the latest data, and the resulting inference outputs are stored in the gold layer of BigQuery. The App module, hosted on a Lightsail instance, loads the updated gold-layer inference and analytics data after each monthly iteration. Within the app, DuckDB is used to locally query and serve this data for fast, efficient access.  Anyway, here‚Äôs the link if you want to play around:  [https://propertyanalytics.uk](https://propertyanalytics.uk)  Note: It currently covers England and Wales, only.  https://preview.redd.it/s220a3z702wf1.png?width=566&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1999caa45801a0ab216fa63e2de09cc9c6dfafaf"

Arguably, I feel like there are three types of data investigations: trivial ones, almost impossible ones, and randomized controlled experiments. The trivial ones are making a plot of a silly KPI, the impossible ones are getting actionable insights from real-world data. Random studies are the one thing in which I (still) trust.   That‚Äôs why I feel like most of my job is being pain in someone‚Äôs ass, finding data flaws, counterfactuals, and all sorts of reasons why whatever stakeholders want is impossible or very expensive to get.   Sometimes Im afraid that data science is just not cost effective. And worse, sometimes I feel like I‚Äôd be a more successful (paid better) data scientist if I did more of meaningless and shallow data astrology, just reinforcing the stakeholders that their ideas are good - because given the reality of data completeness and quality, there‚Äôs no way for me to tell it. Or announcing that I found an area for improvement, deliberately ignoring boring, alternative explanations. And honestly - I think that no one would ever learn what I did.

Both offers are internal, same salary level (France, ~58k‚Ç¨ total, + added bonus and stock on top).  I currently work as a Data Scientist ‚Äì AI Lead in the space division of a major European aerospace group. I lead the internal roadmap for generative AI (RAG, LLM, ESA projects), manage ~400k‚Ç¨/year in R&amp;D budget, and supervise 3 people + 2 interns. Management really believes in me and wants to promote me since I have been applying for new internal opportunities. Today I have 2 options on the same salary bands.  ‚∏ª  Option 1 ‚Äì getting a promotion in my team and Stay in the Space Division  Role: AI Solutions Engineer / Product Owner  Context: Engineering-heavy environment (satellite systems, physics, data).  Commute: 10 min by bike.  Scope:  	‚Ä¢	understand needs and Deploy an tailored ChatGPT-like solution for technical users (~100 users/use case) as we do not have a cloud available.  	‚Ä¢	Integrate generative AI into internal data platforms (500‚Äì800 users).  	‚Ä¢	Manage a total budget of ~1.2M‚Ç¨ (including ~200k R&amp;D).  	‚Ä¢	Supervise subcontractors (to help with the tasks I need, I can delegate everything I want) and handle ESA AI projects (surrogate modeling, etc.).  Pros:  	‚Ä¢	Great work-life balance (flexible hours, local site).  	‚Ä¢	Strong autonomy and technical depth.  	‚Ä¢	Supportive management, solid internal reputation.  	‚Ä¢	Fits my AI/engineering background perfectly.  Cons:  	‚Ä¢	Restricted infra (no public cloud, only internal clusters).  	‚Ä¢	Slow processes and limited tools.  	‚Ä¢	Impact limited to the space business (niche scope).  	‚Ä¢	The space division might merge with another company within 2 years ‚Äî could lead to reorgs, project cancellations, or slower salary progression, and lose of big bonuses. Also current health of the branch is bad.  ‚∏ª  Option 2 ‚Äì Move to the Corporate Digital Department  Role: Project Manager AI for Employee Services (Agentic AI).  Context: Corporate HQ ‚Äì global digital transformation team.  Commute: 35‚Äì40 min by bike.  Scope:  	‚Ä¢	Manage a 1.4M‚Ç¨ budget to deploy AI HR tools (RAG, agentic, ‚Ä¶) and automation tools for 130,000 employees.  	‚Ä¢	Work with IT architects, data scientists, and HR stakeholders.  	‚Ä¢	Access to modern cloud stack (Azure, M365, Vertex AI) in a more mature environment.  	‚Ä¢	Exposure to the Chief Digital Officer and HR top management.  Pros:  	‚Ä¢	Global visibility and strategic exposure.  	‚Ä¢	Full access to modern AI tools and cloud infrastructure.  	‚Ä¢	Larger budget and decision-making autonomy.  	‚Ä¢	Stronger potential long-term financial upside (high corporate bonuses, stock plan). Great financial health of the company.  Cons:  	‚Ä¢	Less technical, even though they agreed I can build PoCs and stay hands on, and be active in the architecture decisions. More project management and stakeholder coordination.  	‚Ä¢	Mostly non-technical interlocutors (HR, business).  	‚Ä¢	More political environment and higher delivery pressure.  	‚Ä¢	Longer commute and less daily flexibility.  ‚∏ª  TL;DR  	‚Ä¢	Option 1 (Space): technical, stable, flexible, management trusts me and promises high career paths, but risk of merger and limited AI or cloud/tools.  	‚Ä¢	Option 2 (Corporate Digital): strategic, bigger scope (130k people), access to modern tools, more political, less hands-on.  	‚Ä¢	Salary: roughly the same (~58k‚Ç¨, + extra stock and bonus).  Question:  Which path would give me the strongest market value in 2 years ‚Äî staying as a hands-on AI lead in the space division or moving into a corporate-level AI project manager role?  I value growth, getting more full remote / part time options well paid later on, and value WLB."

datascience,1o6tquy,Would you recommend starting new agentic projects with Typescript instead of Python?,Illustrious-Pound266,0,15,1760480579.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1o6tquy/would_you_recommend_starting_new_agentic_projects/,I read somewhere that something like 60%-75% of YC-backed startups that are building agents are using Typescript. I've also heard that Typescript's native type system is very helpful for building AI apps. Is Typescript a better language than Python for building AI agents?   I don't planning on training my own models so I am not sure if Python is really necessary in my case.

I have been struggling for a time to find a reliable metric to use that tells me when an answer is correct.  The cost of a **false positive** is very high; there is a huge risk in sending an incorrect answer to the user.  I have been spending most of my time trying to find which metric to use to evaluate the answer.  Here is what I have tried so far:  * I have checked the perplexity or the average log probability of the generated tokens, but it is only consistent when the model cannot find the answer in the provided chunks. The way my prompt is **designed**, in this case, the model returns, ""I cannot find the answer in the provided context\*\*,\*\*"" and that is a good signal when I cannot find the **answer**. * However, when the model is hallucinating an answer based on the provided tokens, it is very confident and returns a high perplexity / average token probability. * I have tried to use the cosine **similarity** between the question and the embeddings. It is okay when the model cannot find the correct chunks; the similarity is low, and for those, I am certain that the answer will be incorrect. But sometimes, the embedding models have some flaws. * I have tried to create a **metric** that is a weighted average of the average cosine **similarity** and the average token probability; it seems to work, but not quite well. * I cannot use an LLM as a judge. I don't think it **works** or is reliable, and the stakeholders do not trust the whole concept of judging the output of an LLM with another LLM. * I am in the process of getting **samples** of questions and answers labelled by **humans** who answer these questions in practice to see which metric will **correlate** with the human answer.  **Other information:**  For now, I am only working with 164 **samples** of **questions**. Is this good enough? The **business** is planning on providing us with more questions to test the system.  The workflow I am suggesting for production is this:  1. Get the question. 2. If the average cosine **similarity** between the question and the chunks is low, route the question to an agent because we cannot find the answer. 3. If it is high, we send it to the LLM and prompt it to generate an **answer** based on the context. If the LLM cannot find the answer in the provided context, send it to the agent. 4. If it **says** it can find the answer, **generate** the answer and the reference. Check the average distance and the average token probability; if it is low, send it to the agent. 5. Now, if the answer is there, there are enough references, and the **weighted** average of the token probability is high, send the answer to the user.  How do you think about this approach? What are other **ways** I can do better in order to evaluate and increase the number of answers I am sending to the user? For those who have worked with RAG in production, how do you handle this type of problem?  How do you quantify the **business** impact of **such a** system?  I think if I manage to **answer** 50% of the users' queries correctly and the other 50% of queries go to an agent, the system **reduces** the workload of the agent by 50%.  But my boss is saying that it is not a good system if it is just 50% accurate, and **sometimes** the agents will stop using it in production. Is that true?"

My focus has been on LLM R&amp;D, RAG pipelines, satellite telemetry anomaly detection, surrogate modeling, and some FPGA-compatible ML for onboard systems. I also mentor interns, coordinate small R&amp;D projects, and occasionally present findings internally.  The context is tough (departures, headcount freezes) and I have an opportunity to move to a large aeronautics company or stay in my team, but grow in scope.  I‚Äôm now evaluating two potential next roles (which I might intend as ~2-year commitments before moving on) and would love advice from anyone who has experience with either path:  ‚∏ª  Option 1 ‚Äì AI Product Manager / Project Manager in HR  	‚Ä¢	Deploy 8 AI agents across HR services, impacting ~130k employees.  	‚Ä¢	Lead roadmap, orchestrate AI integrations, and liaise with IT and HR VPs.  	‚Ä¢	Focus on coordination, strategy, and high-level product ownership.  	‚Ä¢	Access to cutting-edge generative AI tools and cloud-based agentic workflows.  	‚Ä¢	High exposure to senior stakeholders and leadership opportunities.  	‚Ä¢	Some political stress: managing expectations of VPs, cross-team alignment, continuous meetings. It is said to be a quite political environment as you deal with HR and not just engineers.  ‚∏ª  Option 2 ‚Äì Big data product owner + AI R&amp;D manager (Tech + Product Ownership) in Space  	‚Ä¢	Merge internal Big Data platforms and integrate AI/analytics pipelines and PO role for a 600 user data lake platform (on premise due to security constraints), coordinating subcontractors.  	‚Ä¢	Manage R&amp;D programs with subcontractors, support bids, and deploy ML models.  	‚Ä¢	some Hands-on technical + coordination (MLops, RAG, keeping 1 data science R&amp;D project as a IC and take subs for the rest), some product ownership.  	‚Ä¢	Exposure mostly internal; less political stress, but operational and technical expectations remain high.  	‚Ä¢	Technical constraints due to working in a defense context: access to cutting-edge AI tools is limited, and infrastructure is slower/more constrained.  	‚Ä¢	Opportunity to remain in the aerospace/space field I‚Äôm passionate about, but external market is niche.  ‚∏ª  My Considerations  	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôm not an elite coder; my strength is prototyping, vision, and leadership rather than optimizing code.  	‚Ä¢	Life-work balance is important; I do ~12‚Äì20h of meetings per week currently and enjoy running, cycling, and other hobbies.  	‚Ä¢	Option 1 offers exposure to latest AI technologies and high-level leadership, but comes with political challenges. Also, HR tech is not sexy.  	‚Ä¢	Option 2 is more technical and personally interesting (space), but tools and infrastructure are slower, and the field is more niche. Plus it‚Äôs in a crisis in Europe meaning we could have 2-5 years of stagnation.  ‚∏ª  Questions to the community:  	1.	If you had to choose between strategic PM exposure with generative AI vs hands-on hybrid tech + product in a niche field, which would you pick early in your career?  	2.	Which path do you think gives the strongest leverage for leadership or high-profile opportunities?  	3.	Any advice on navigating political stress if I take the PM role?  	4.	Are there hybrid ways to make the PM role technically ‚Äúsexier‚Äù or future-proof in AI?        5.   I am also considering moving into high paid remote roles such as tech sales in the future. Which would work as the best intermediate role ?  Thanks in advance for your insights! Any real-world experience, pros/cons, or anecdotal advice is hugely appreciated."

Currently I do end to end modeling, from gathering data up to production (not in the most data sciency way since I'm very limited in terms of tools but my models are being effectively used by other departments).   I have built 5 different models: propensity score models, customer segmentation, churn models and a time series forecasting model.  All my job has been revolving around developing, validating, monitoring and updating these models I have built with the current tools I have available.  I realise I'm already privileged in terms of what I'm doing. It's my first job and already developing models end to end in a company that recognises their usefulness and I'm pretty much free to take any decision about them.  However, I would love to advance further since the my job is starting to get a bit repetitive. In terms of innovating further my workflow I realised it's actually pretty much impossible. The company IT is stagnant and any time I asked for anything, like introducing MlFlow in my sagemaker flow (YES, from development to ""production"" is done in sagemaker using notebooks. I understand and have faced many of the problems that come out of this) or Airflow or anything else, the request has never gotten anywhere. The size of the company and the IT privileges setup makes it impossible for me to take the innovation in my own hands and do as I please. I've tried lots of technical workarounds and loopholes but not very successfully.   I don't feel confident enough now take a more senior position, nor there is the possibility at my current job. My boss is not directly involved in modeling stuff and don't really have anyone I can go to with career progression questions.  I feel like I kinda already reached the end of progression and I'm pretty much lost in terms of what I can do, other than ask for various tools to make the pipeline up to current standards (which will not have an impact in terms of how the output will be used by other departments and profits).  I understand it's an open ended question, but what else could I do to advance?"

After working in retail for 11 years, I went back to school in 2020 to do a Bachelor‚Äôs in Mathematics and a masters in analytics.  I was hoping to become a data scientist upon graduating.  Obviously, market conditions have fluctuated substantially since I started.    I took a job as a materials planner in electronics manufacturing, with the expectation that my boss was looking for someone that was data minded and would primarily focus on building pipelines and tools to make things run more smoothly.   my planning duties would be small while I used my skills to automate and streamline workflows.  Up to this point, my job has been about 70 percent coding and ‚Äúdata engineering/analyzing‚Äù, 20 percent managing and organizing my projects, and 10 percent actual materials planning.

datascience,1nsxpad,"Oscillatory Coordination in Cognitive Architectures: Old Dog, New Math",Efficient-Hovercraft,0,2,1759088818.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1nsxpad/oscillatory_coordination_in_cognitive/,"Been working in AI since before it was cool (think 80s expert systems, not ChatGPT hype). Lately I've been developing this cognitive architecture called OGI that uses Top-K gating between specialized modules. Works well, proved the stability, got the complexity down to O(k¬≤). But something's been bugging me about the whole approach. The central routing feels... inelegant. Like we're forcing a fundamentally parallel, distributed process through a computational bottleneck. Your brain doesn't have a little scheduler deciding when your visual cortex can talk to your language areas. So I've been diving back into some old neuroscience papers on neural oscillations. Turns out biological neural networks coordinate through phase-locking across different frequency bands - gamma for local binding, theta for memory consolidation, alpha for attention. No central controller needed. The Math That's Getting Me Excited Started modeling cognitive modules as weakly coupled oscillators. Each module i has intrinsic frequency œâ·µ¢ and phase Œ∏·µ¢(t), with dynamics: Œ∏Ãá·µ¢ = œâ·µ¢ + Œ£‚±º A·µ¢‚±º sin(Œ∏‚±º - Œ∏·µ¢ + Œ±·µ¢‚±º) This is just Kuramoto model with adaptive coupling strengths A·µ¢‚±º and phase lags Œ±·µ¢‚±º that encode computational dependencies. When |œâ·µ¢ - œâ‚±º| falls below critical coupling threshold, modules naturally phase-lock and start coordinating. The order parameter R(t) = |Œ£‚±º e^(iŒ∏‚±º)|/N gives you a continuous measure of how synchronized the whole system is. Instead of discrete routing decisions, you get smooth phase relationships that preserve gradient flow. Why This Might Actually Work Three big advantages I'm seeing:  Scalability: Communication cost scales with active phase-locked clusters, not total modules. For sparse coupling graphs, this could be near-linear. Robustness: Lyapunov analysis suggests exponential convergence to stable states. System naturally self-corrects. Temporal Multiplexing: Different frequency bands can carry orthogonal information streams without interference. Massive bandwidth increase.  The Hard Problems Obviously the devil's in the details. How do you encode actual computational information in phase relationships? How do you learn the coupling matrix A(t)? Probably need some variant of Hebbian plasticity, but the specifics matter. The inverse problem is fascinating though - given desired computational dependencies, what coupling topology produces the right synchronization patterns? Starting to look like optimal transport theory applied to dynamical systems. Bigger Picture Maybe we've been thinking about AI architecture wrong. Instead of discrete computational graphs, what if cognition is fundamentally about temporal organization of information flow? The binding problem, consciousness, unified experience - could all emerge from phase coherence mathematics. I know this sounds hand-wavy, but the math is solid. Kuramoto theory is well-established, neural oscillations are real, and the computational advantages are compelling. Anyone worked on similar problems? Particularly interested in numerical integration schemes for large coupled oscillator networks and learning rules for adaptive coupling.  Edit: For those asking about implementation - yes, this requires continuous dynamics instead of discrete updates. Computationally more expensive per step, but potentially fewer steps needed due to natural coordination. Still working out the trade-offs.  Edit 2: Getting DMs about biological plausibility. Obviously artificial oscillators don't need to match neural firing rates exactly. The key insight is coordination through phase relationships, not literal biological mimicry.  Mike"

For my current job, I don't need to be an expert in machine learning, deep learning, or data engineering, but I've been trying to learn the basics anyway.  I feel like even a basic understanding helps me out in a few ways:  * Better Problem-Solving: It helps me choose the right tool for the job and come up with better solutions. * Deeper Analysis: I can push my analyses further and ask more interesting questions. * Smoother Communication: It makes talking to data scientists and engineers on my team way easier because I kinda ""get"" what they're doing.  Plus, I've noticed that just learning one new library or concept makes picking up the next one a lot less intimidating.  What do you all think?

A little bit about me: I just got my bachelors in data science and economics this past May from Berkeley as well, and I'm starting a job as a data scientist this month at a medium sized company. My goal is to become a data scientist, and a lot of people have advised me to do a data science master's since it's so competitive nowadays. My plan originally was to do the master's along with my job, but I'm a bit worried about the time commitment. Even though the people in my company say we have a chill 9-5 culture, the MIDS program will require 20-30 hours of work for the first semester because everyone is required to take 2 classes in the beginning. That means I'll have to work 60+ hours a week, at least during the first semester, although I'm not sure how accurate this time commitment is, since I already have coding experience from my bachelor's. Another thing I'm worried about is cost. Berkeley MIDS costs 67k for me (original was 80k+ but I got a scholarship). Even though I'm lucky enough to have my parents' financial support, I still hate for them to spend so much money. I also applied to UPenn's MSE-DS program, which is not as good as Berkeley's but it's significantly cheaper (38k), but I won't know the results until November, and I'm hoping to get back to Berkeley before then. Should I just not do a masters until several years down the line, or should I decline Berkeley and wait for UPenn's results? What's my best course of action? Thank you üôè"

I had an interview earlier this week for a research scientist job that I was hoping to get an outside perspective on - I'm pretty new to technical interviewing and there don't seem to be many online resources about what interviewers expectations are going to be for more probability-style questions. I was not selected for a next round of interviews based on my performance, and that's at odds with my self-assessment and with the affect and demeanor of the interviewer.      **The Interview Questions:** A question asking about probabilistic decay of N particles (over discrete time steps, known probability), and was asked to derive the probability that all particles would decay by a certain time. Then, I was asked to write a simulation of this scenario, and get point estimates, variance &amp;c. Lastly, I was asked about a variation where I would estimate the probability, given observed counts.      **My Performance:** I correctly characterized the problem as a Binomial(N,p) problem, where p is the probability that a single particle survives till time T. I did not get a closed form solution (I asked about how I did at the end and the interviewer mentioned that it would have been nice to get one). The code I wrote was correct, and I think fairly efficient? I got a little bit hung up on trying to estimate variance, but ended up with a bootstrap approach. We ran out of time before I could entirely solve the last variation, but generally described an approach. I felt that my interviewer and I had decent rapport, and it seemed like I did decently.      **Question:** Overall, I'd like to know what I did wrong, though of course that's probably not possible without someone sitting in. I did talk throughout, and I have struggled with clear and concise verbal communication in the past. Was the expectation that I would solve all parts of the questions completely?

datascience,1nq1bj4,Introducing ryxpress: Reproducible Polyglot Analytical Pipelines with Nix (Python),brodrigues_co,2,2,1758789079.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1nq1bj4/introducing_ryxpress_reproducible_polyglot/,"Hi everyone,  These past weeks I've been working on an R and Python package (called rixpress and ryxpress respectively) which aim to make it easy to build multilanguage projects by using Nix as the underlying build tool.  ryxpress is a Python port of the R package `{rixpress}`, both in early development and they let you define data pipelines in R (with helpers for Python steps), build them reproducibly using Nix, and then inspect, read, or load artifacts from Python.  If you're familiar with the `{targets}` R package, this is very similar.  It‚Äôs designed to provide a smoother experience for those working in polyglot environments (Python, R, Julia and even Quarto/Markdown for reports) where reproducibility and cross-language workflows matter.  Pipelines are defined in R, but the artifacts can be explored and loaded in Python, opening up easy interoperability for teams or projects using both languages.  It uses Nix as the underyling build tool, so you get the power of Nix for dependency management, but can work in Python for artifact inspection and downstream tasks.  Here is a basic definition of a pipeline:  ``` library(rixpress)  list(   rxp_py_file(     name = mtcars_pl,     path = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/b-rodrigues/rixpress_demos/refs/heads/master/basic_r/data/mtcars.csv',     read_function = ""lambda x: polars.read_csv(x, separator='|')""   ),    rxp_py(     name = mtcars_pl_am,     expr = ""mtcars_pl.filter(polars.col('am') == 1)"",     user_functions = ""functions.py"",     encoder = ""serialize_to_json"",   ),    rxp_r(     name = mtcars_head,     expr = my_head(mtcars_pl_am),     user_functions = ""functions.R"",     decoder = ""jsonlite::fromJSON""   ),    rxp_r(     name = mtcars_mpg,     expr = dplyr::select(mtcars_head, mpg)   ) ) |&gt;   rxp_populate(project_path = ""."") ```  It's R code, but as explained, you can build it from Python and explore build artifacts from Python as well. You'll also need to define the ""execution environment"" in which this pipeline is supposed to run, using Nix as well.  ryxpress is on PyPI, but you‚Äôll need Nix (and R + {rixpress}) installed. See the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/ryxpress) for quickstart instructions and environment setup.  Would love feedback, questions, or ideas for improvements! If you‚Äôre interested in reproducible, multi-language pipelines, give it a try."

We want it to be the most usable RAG builder, while also offering powerful options for finding the ideal RAG parameters.  Highlights:  * **Easy to get started**: just drop in documents, select a template configuration, and you're up and running in a few minutes. * **Highly customizable**: you can customize the document extractor, chunking strategy, embedding model/dimension, and search index (vector/full-text/hybrid). Start simple with one-click templates, but go as deep as you want on tuning/customization. * **Document library**: manage documents, tag document sets, preview extractions, sync across your team, and more. * **Deep integrations**: evaluate RAG-task performance with our evals, expose RAG as a tool to any tool-compatible model * **Local**: the Kiln app runs locally and we can't access your data. The V1 of RAG requires API keys for extraction/embeddings, but we're working on fully-local RAG as we speak; see below for questions about where we should focus.  We have docs walking through the process: [https://docs.kiln.tech/docs/documents-and-search-rag](https://docs.kiln.tech/docs/documents-and-search-rag)  **Question for you:** V1 has a decent number of options for tuning, but folks are probably going to want more. We‚Äôd love suggestions for where to expand first. Options are:  * **Document extraction**: V1 focuses on model-based extractors (Gemini/GPT) as they outperformed library-based extractors (docling, markitdown) in our tests. Which additional models/libraries/configs/APIs would you want? Specific open models? Marker? Docling? * **Embedding Models**: We're looking at EmbeddingGemma &amp; Qwen Embedding as open/local options. Any other embedding models people like for RAG? * **Chunking**: V1 uses the sentence splitter from llama\_index. Do folks have preferred semantic chunkers or other chunking strategies? * **Vector database**: V1 uses LanceDB for vector, full-text (BM25), and hybrid search. Should we support more? Would folks want Qdrant? Chroma? Weaviate? pg-vector? HNSW tuning parameters? * Anything else?

Data Analyst / Product Analytics: dashboards, data analysis, A/B testing. 	 2.	MLE: build machine learning systems for user-facing products (e.g., Stripe‚Äôs fraud detection or YouTube‚Äôs recommendation algorithm). 	 3.	DS: use ML and advanced techniques to solve business problems and make forecasts (e.g., sales, growth, churn).  This last job is not done by MLEs, it has simply been eliminated by some companies in the last few years (but a lot of tech companies still have it).  For example Stripe used to hire DSs specifically for this function and LinkedIn profiles confirm that those people are still there doing it, but now the new hires consist only of Data Analysts.  It‚Äôs hard to believe that in a world increasingly driven by data, a role focused on predictive decision making would be seen as completely useless.

As they were most related to the treated group.      Then would use something like TMLE,psw etc to find the ATE.     How do you decide what to do if there isnt any domain knowledge, is there a textbook or methods you follow to conduct your tests?"

E.g.:  Data 1: [(3,5,0),(4,6,1)], label = 1 Data 2: [(6,3,0)], label = 0  I‚Äôm having trouble getting my ChatGPT-coded model to perform, which is surprising since I was able to get decent results when I just looked at one of the 3 featured with the same ordering, data, and number of steps.  Any boilerplate Python code would be of great help. I‚Äôm unable to find something basic online, but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs out there so appreciate being pointed in the right direction."

Instead of fiddling with prompts that sometimes regress, you just build up examples. Each example improves accuracy in a concrete way, and you often need far fewer than traditional ML approaches.    How it works (prototype is live):  \- Upload a document (DOCX, PDF, image, etc.)  \- Select and tag parts of it (supports nesting, arrays, custom tag structures)  \- Upload another document ‚Üí click ""predict"" ‚Üí see editable annotations  \- Amend them and save as another example  \- Call the API with a third document ‚Üí get JSON back    Potential use cases:  \- Identify important clauses in contracts  \- Extract total value from invoices  \- Subjective tags like ‚Äúhealthy ingredients‚Äù on a label  \- Objective tags like ‚Äúpostcode‚Äù or ‚Äúphone number‚Äù  It seems to generalize well: you can even tag things like ‚Äúgood rhymes‚Äù in a poem. Basically anything an LLM can comprehend and extrapolate.    I‚Äôd love feedback on:  \- Does this kind of few-shot / K-shot approach seem useful in practice?  \- Are there other document-processing scenarios where this would be particularly impactful?  \- Pitfalls you‚Äôd anticipate?     I've called this ""DeepTagger"", first link on google if you search that, if you want to try it! It's fully working, but this is just a first version."
datascience,1njcvfv,Example Take Home Assignment For Interview - Data Science in Finance,chasing_green_roads,56,17,1758114945.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1njcvfv/example_take_home_assignment_for_interview_data/,"Edit: formatting data dictionary  Hello,  Thought this might be an interesting post for some, especially those of us who work at Financial Institutions. Here is a take home assignment used in the interview process to evaluate candidates for a data scientist role in the financial industry. This company does personal lending in the US.  Hopefully this is enough on topic (and not against the rules) as this is for a data scientist role, but it also is very financially focused. I'm not looking for help in anyway, just hope this might helpful to someone looking for a role in this area. I know a lot of people are against take home assignments, I get it, but the reality is many employers still use them.  I'll try to format things as best as possible, but it's tough when you can't post attachments.  **Instructions**  Employer uses machine learning models to evaluate borrower risk and determine loan eligibility. In July 2024, we launched **Model B** to replace **Model A**, aiming to improve loan approvals and portfolio returns. Our executive team has expressed concern that Model B might be underperforming in some cases.  Your task is to assess the performance of Models A and B across these loan product types and answer the central question: **Should we roll back to Model A or keep and improve Model B?** Additionally, analyze the dataset to uncover any other insights that could guide our decision-making and optimize our lending strategy.  Please put together a presentation summarizing your findings, insights, and recommendations. Assume your audience has a low level of familiarity with the specifics of the problem but will appreciate clear, data-driven reasoning and business implications. You will present your findings in a 45 minute meeting with stakeholders but ensure to leave ample time for their questions.  **Data Dictionary (for the two attachments below):**  * *Origination Month:* Month in which the loan was funded. * *Payment Month:* Payments are made monthly. The first payment is made a month after origination. Payment number refers to future payments from the loans that originated in the specified month. For an origination taking place in Jan 2023, their 1st payment month will take place in Feb 2023, their 2nd payment month will take place in March 2023, etc‚Ä¶ * *Model Version:* Model\_A is the original model and Model\_B is the new, updated model. * *Scheduled Loan Repayment:* The loan repayments as determined by the amortization schedule at origination. * *Forecasted Loan Repayment:* The loan repayments that are forecasted by each model at origination. * *Actual Loan Repayment:* The actual loan repayments made during each payment month by borrowers. * *Application Submits:* Loan applications that are submitted. * *Origination Amount:* The initial principal amount when the loan is funded. * *Note: Employer earns revenue as a % fee of the loan origination amount and the investor (Employer‚Äôs lending partners which provide the capital for Employer to lend) earns returns based on interest net loss*  **Attachment 1**  || || |Month|Application Submits|Origination

datascience,1nhzoam,Advice on presenting yourself,-Cicada7-,25,14,1757973972.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1nhzoam/advice_on_presenting_yourself/,"Hello everyone, I recently got the chance to speak with the HR at a healthcare company that‚Äôs working on AI agents to optimize prescription pricing.  While I haven‚Äôt directly built AI agents before, I‚Äôd like to design a small prototype for my hiring manager round and use that discussion to show how I can tackle their challenges. I‚Äôve got about a week to prepare and only ~30 minutes for the conversation, so I‚Äôm looking for advice on: - How to outline the initial architecture for a project like this (at a high level). - What aspects of the design/implementation are most valuable for a hiring manager or senior engineer to see. - What to leave out and what to keep so the presentation/my pitch stays focused and impactful.  Appreciate any thoughts‚Äîespecially from folks who have been on the hiring side and know what really makes someone stand out. I am just a bit confused that even if I have a prototype how should I present it naturally and smartly.  Edit : the goal here is to optimize the prescription price by lowering prices where it's still profitable for the company."
datascience,1nhskvc,How do you factor seasonality in A/B test experiments? Which methods you personally use and why?,Starktony11,42,40,1757958028.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1nhskvc/how_do_you_factor_seasonality_in_ab_test/,"Hi,   I was wondering how do you perform the experiment and factor the seasonality while analyzing it?  (Especially on e-commerce side)   For example i often wonder when marketing campaigns are done during black Friday/holiday season, how do they know whether the campaign had the causal effect? And how much? When we know people tend to buy more things in holiday season.   So what test or statistical methods do you use to factor into? Or what are the other methods you use to find how the campaign performed?   First i think of is use historical data of the same season for last year, and compare it, but what if we don‚Äôt have historical data?   What other things need to keep in mind while designing an experiment when we know seasonality could be play big role? And there‚Äôs no way we can perform the experiment outside of season?   Thanks!   Edit- 2nd question, lets say we want to run a promotion during a season, like bf sale, how do you keep treatment and control? Or how do you analyze the effect of sale? As you would not want to hold out on users during sales? Or what companies do during this time to keep a control group ?"
