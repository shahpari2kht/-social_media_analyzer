1oje977,So what do y’all think of the Amazon layoffs?,Lamp_Shade_Head,116,64,1761766511.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1oje977/so_what_do_yall_think_of_the_amazon_layoffs/,"I’ve heard that many BIEs and data professionals have been laid off recently. It’s quite unsettling to see, and I’m feeling anxious both as an employee, since it could happen at my company too and as a job seeker, knowing that many of those laid-off professionals will now be competing in the job market alongside me."

1oigf8k,burning out because nothing takes as short as the time im expected to complete tasks,thro0away12,85,20,1761674097.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1oigf8k/burning_out_because_nothing_takes_as_short_as_the/,"I work as a data engineer/analytics engineer and am given about 2 weeks to fully develop 3-4 datasets that are used in the backend for various applications. The issue is the following:  1. Theoretically, if I had even 80% clarity in requirements, I could probably finish a dataset in a span of 1-3 days. However, this is never the case - the requirements are frequently 50% clear, I have to figure that out along developing the dataset. When there’s an issue upstream of me, I have to go back to the source files and dig deep why something is missing. I have to wait on another engineer frequently in the process to either QA why something is missing or merge my pull requests which has frequent delays.   2. In between all of this work, I frequently get asked to make enhancements or fix bugs from previous work that can easily eat 1-3 days. Some of these bugs are random and occur because the source data upstream of me randomly changed that broke my entire process. Enhancements sound simple in theory until I actually work on it.   3. There’s no standard QA process. I told my boss I wanted to develop scripts to do QA as frequently in the past if we had data issues, I would be notified by either my boss or a stakeholder because they happened to notice the issue. I figured if I run a daily script where I can get an automated email that shows all my datasets and what’s going on, it can be easier to be proactive rather than reactive. My boss said that this is something another team is working on developing but there’s no sign that there is such a thing being developed and developing a QA process for every individual project is entirely on me to figure out   4. There’s NO documentation. My team is trying to get better at this but all my projects have been a product of zero past documentation. In order to get better at this, I’m expected to create documentation on top of all this work. Documentation can easily take me 1-2 days for each project and sometimes it gets pushed to the side because of focusing on 1-3.  Even documenting on Jira easily takes me 30 mins - 1 hour   5. Add 3 hours of meeting a day on this already full plate    Instead of 3 projects in 2 weeks, I feel if my focus was on just one project - from development, QA, documentation, it would be way more manageable. But there isn’t really an option on my team as they’re obsessed with scaling up, I’m frequently told everything is a priority. My eating and sleeping schedule had gotten so messed up in the span of the past few months - I don’t have time to make breakfast, lunch or dinner and end up skipping meals a lot. I wish to get a new job and would have easily started applying now if the economy wasn’t so bad.   I’m wondering if others have experienced similar."

1ojb3u5,How I would land FAANG DS in 2025,LeaguePrototype,0,15,1761759518.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1ojb3u5/how_i_would_land_faang_ds_in_2025/,"step 1: Have 3-5 years experience for L4 (No such thing as Junior DS at FAANG)  step 2: Don't not have 3-5 years experience  step 3: Get MSc in Stats/Comp sci./Physics/etc. (do not go for DS degree)  step 4: Look on career site for which locations they are hiring for DS, move or be ready to move there. Easier to get headcount in Big US offices, latin America, Eastern Europe, India  step 5: Look what kind of roles they are hiring for and what matches your skillset  step 6: Tailor your resume, create projects if you don't have experience, for the roles they are hiring for. DS means a lot of things, and big companies are looking for specialists not generalists. There's someone to do ops, someone to do cloud engineering, someone to do dashboards, etc.  step 7: Apply as much as you can, reach out and get referral from someone. Don't talk yourself out of applying  step 8: Study at a bare minimum 20-50 hours for each hour of interview. Make sure you study for topics relevant to the role (ex. if it's in product analytics you won't have to know much ML ops)  step 9: Interview well. You have to be perfect when it comes to the fundamentals. With an 8/10 performance you will either be rejected or request follow up interviews, anything below that doesn't cut it. Your english and fundamental technical skills must be perfect. Any signs of incompetence when it comes to the basics will be red flags. You must know 'why' not just the 'what'."
1oiaj5d,"Your feedback got my resource list added to the official ""awesome-datascience"" repo",DeepAnalyze,15,4,1761660897.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1oiaj5d/your_feedback_got_my_resource_list_added_to_the/,"Hi everyone,  A little while back, I shared my curated list of data science resources here as a public GitHub repo. The feedback was really valuable.  Thanks for all the suggestions and feedback. Here's what was improved thanks to your ideas:  * **Added new sections:** MLOps, AI Applications &amp; Platforms, and Cloud Platforms &amp; Infrastructure to make the list more comprehensive. * **Reworked the structure:** Split some bulky sections up. Hopefully now it's less overwhelming and easier to navigate. * **Packed more useful Python:** Added more useful Python libraries into each section to help find the right tool faster. * **Set up auto-checks**: Implemented an automatic check for broken links to keep the list fresh and reliable.  A nice outcome: the list is now part of the main ""Awesome Data Science"" repository, which many of you probably know.  If you have more suggestions, I'd love to hear them in the comments. I'm especially curious if adding new subsections for Books or YouTube channels within existing chapters (alongside Resources and Tools) would be useful.  The list is here: [View on GitHub](https://github.com/PavelGrigoryevDS/awesome-data-analysis#readme)  P.S. Thanks again. This whole process really showed me how powerful Reddit can be for getting real, expert feedback."

It also appears that a GLM with a Wald test would be a appropriate in this case, though I have little experience or exposure to these concepts.   I'd appreciate any resources, advice, or pointers. Thank you so much for reading!"
